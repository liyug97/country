Recently, a website carried out a survey called "What do you care most about the 17th National Congress". Anti-corruption ranked first. In the report of the Seventeenth National Congress, there are also many new ideas on anti-corruption. Recently, the reporter interviewed Liu Chun, vice president and professor of the Graduate School of the Party School of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anti-corruption, Focusing on Reasonable and Scientific Power Operation Structure<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People's Forum Reporter: The report of the 17th National Congress of the CPC pointed out that power must be allowed to operate in the sunshine. We should insist on using the system to manage power, affairs and people, and establish and improve the power structure and operation mechanism of mutual restriction and coordination among decision-making power, executive power and supervisory power. Would you please interpret the profound connotation of it? What is the practical significance of our Party's efforts to solve the problem of anti-corruption at present and for a long time to come?<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Liu Chun: It should be said that the statement of power structure and its operation mechanism at the 17th National Congress reflects the general principle of the healthy operation of power, is a new understanding of the law of power restriction and supervision by the Party, and is also an important guide to promote the construction of power restriction and supervision mechanism.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbspnbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we all know, the development of power restriction and supervision is premised, and the first prerequisite is the rationality of power structure. Therefore, the establishment of power structure should not only consider the operational efficiency of the organization, but also focus on ensuring the rationality of the use of power.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Usually within an organization and between organizations, especially those that implement collective decision-making and collective responsibility, if the allocation of power and resources is not scientific, there is no reasonable division of labor, individual functional parts have too much control over the whole, or other functional groups can not effectively control it, they will be in the group. There is a huge gap in the ability to form between weaving and organization. The low rationality of organizational structure and the low level of scientificalization often make the rational exercise of power subject to contingency. It is easy to form a space for arbitrary exercise of power and abuse of power, and it is difficult to achieve standardized administration and administration according to law. Therefore, the Seventeenth National Congress emphasizes that decision-making power, executive power and supervisory power are mutually restricted and coordinated, which is to focus on a reasonable and scientific power operation structure.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scientificity of the current allocation of political power functions needs to be improved<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People's Forum Reporter: In practice, how to realize the rational division and cooperation of decision-making power, executive power and supervisory power? What aspects of the allocation of political power functions need to be improved in the current political system?<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Liu Chun: The rational division and cooperation of decision-making power, executive power and supervisory power are the important basis for the power system to achieve performance goals. If the function allocation of the power subject is not scientific, it will not only be difficult to ensure the effective operation of the political system, but also directly affect the development of power supervision and restriction.。<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In practice, the scientific allocation of political power functions in the current political system still needs to be improved. Among the leading organs and government organs of the Party, between government organs and other organs of government, between government organs and enterprises, between government organs and people's organizations, many functional activities are not standardized. Strong and unscientific division of labor. There are many overlaps between decision-making power and executive power, and it is difficult to distinguish supervisory power from executive power of decision-making power effectively, which not only directly affects work efficiency, but also makes it difficult to supervise and restrict normal and effective power, which inevitably leads to vague judgment on specific acts of exercising power.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the scientific allocation of power functions is an inevitable requirement to improve work efficiency and enhance the normative and legitimacy of power behavior. Only from the scientific analysis, according to the positioning of different power subjects to determine their functional roles, and correctly handle the division of labor and cooperation between different functional departments, can we lay a reasonable foundation for the supervision and restriction of power. To effectively solve the problems still existing in China's power operation mechanism, "promoting scientific and democratic decision-making, improving decision-making information and intellectual support system" is particularly critical.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rigorous Procedure is the Inevitable Requirement of Power's Sunshine Operation<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People's Forum Reporter: To make power run on the track of legalization, we need a reasonable and scientific power operation structure. How to reflect it in practice?<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Liu Chun: The function of public power operation is to distribute social resources and values, especially the exercise of government power. Whether it is macro-control or market supervision, it directly or indirectly controls or influences the allocation of resources. It should be noted that the smooth operation of a reasonable and scientific power structure requires a set of strict procedural norms. Procedural issues play an extremely important role in the operation of power. China's modernization and reform and opening-up belong to the government-led model, which highlights the significance of government power operation procedures for the economic and social construction of a harmonious society.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the specific process of political leadership and government administration, the procedural degree of power operation is not high, and there is no strict and accurate procedural provisions and basis, which directly affects the effective implementation of power restriction and supervision. It not only leaves loopholes for malfeasance, but also leads to the inability of external and internal supervision and restriction activities. Therefore, it has become a top priority to improve the procedure of using power and strictly regulate the procedural elements of exercising power. Only on the clear and rigorous track of procedure can we judge whether the power act is justified or not, and can we really carry out the restriction and supervision of power. Therefore, strict procedures are the necessary requirement for power to run smoothly in the sun and be easy to monitor.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Promoting the Improvement and Innovation of the Means of Power Supervision and Restriction

  　<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People's Forum Reporter: According to the report of the 17th National Congress of the CPC, how to enhance the synergy and effectiveness of supervision is the problem we have to face. Then how can we make the restriction and supervision of power achieve the desired results?<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Liu Chun: Only by adopting scientific and feasible means can the restriction and supervision of power achieve the desired effect, thus ensuring the operation of power is a sunshine process. The choice of steps and means to restrict supervision must focus on actual performance.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the connotation, power restriction is more powerful than power supervision. Restriction refers to the control, control and restraint of power, while supervision mainly focuses on the supervision and supervision of specific subjects. The subject of power restriction is mostly the public power department, which is the mutual restraint and restraint formed by the different division of labor and responsibility between the power departments on the legal track. This determines that the means of restriction and the means of power function are more intrinsically linked.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to achieve effective constraints, it is necessary to improve and perfect the means of constraints on government power and explore ways and means to enhance the effectiveness of constraints and supervision on the basis of rational structure, scientific allocation and rigorous procedures, according to the characteristics of the functions of the main bodies in the public power system. In this regard, ideological education, specific institutional measures, strict liability mechanism and punishment for violations of law and discipline need to be further explored and improved. According to the plan of the 17th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, under the general goal of building a harmonious socialist society, according to the new development and new situation of the anti-corruption struggle and the construction of a clean and honest government, while adhering to the effective traditional means, we should promote the improvement and innovation of the means of power supervision and restriction.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Links to information<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Key words of combating corruption and advocating honesty since the 16th National Congress
  　<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new formulations, popular vocabulary and catchwords in the anti-corruption work in the past five years have witnessed the process of anti-corruption, and we can feel from the side the stormy course and gratifying achievements of anti-corruption in the past five years：<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inspection: In November 2002, the 16th National Congress of the Communist Party of China made a major decision to reform and improve the Party's discipline inspection system and establish and improve the inspection system.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inner-Party Supervision: On December 31, 2003, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued the Regulations on Inner-Party Supervision of the Communist Party of China (for trial implementation). This is the first basic law in the history of our Party to systematically regulate the work of inner-party supervision.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Punishment and prevention system: The Third Plenary Session of the 16th CPC Central Committee first put forward a brand-new proposition of "establishing and improving a system of punishment and prevention of corruption with equal emphasis on education, system and supervision in line with the socialist market economic system". On January 3, 2005, the Outline for Implementing the System of Punishment and Prevention of Corruption, which lays equal stress on education, system and supervision, was officially issued.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Governance of commercial bribery: "Concentrate on special actions to control commercial bribery." On December 20, 2005, the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China made this important decision when studying and deploying the work of building a clean and honest Party conduct and anti-corruption in 2006.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sixteen-Character Policy: On January 9, 2007, in his speech at the Seventh Plenary Session of the Central Discipline Commission, General Secretary Hu Jintao upgraded the strategic policy of combating corruption and advocating honesty from "treating both symptoms and symptoms, comprehensive management, punishment and prevention simultaneously, and paying attention to prevention".<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;State Administration for the Prevention of Corruption: On September 13, 2007, the State Administration for the Prevention of Corruption was officially established.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People's Forum (2007-10-15)<br><br>
