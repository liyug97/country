  <p>Wang Yiping was a researcher at the Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Always take the people's illness as the pursuit of life, research and develop modern Chinese medicine Danshen polyphenolate, benefit more than 20 million patients; he pursues excellence, innovation, has completed more than 50 new drug pharmacodynamic evaluation, and built a complete cardiovascular drug R & D platform and system; he is persistent and persistent, with tenacious perseverance and optimism, 25 years of unremitting struggle with the disease, and obsessed with scientific research. </p>
  <p>On April 11, 2018, Wang Yiping died in the office due to illness, only 55 years old. </p>

<h2 class="h2"><span>2</span>Character Research</h2>
<div class="content4"><br>
  <p>Long-term research on cardiovascular pharmacology, molecular mechanism and new drug research and development of natural products and their derivatives. It has completed the 863 project of the Ministry of Science and Technology, the national “Eleventh Five-Year Plan”, “Major New Drug Creation”, and Shanghai Biomedicine. Scientific research projects such as major projects; the new drug Danshen polyphenolate powder injection has been applied in clinical, with remarkable curative effect, safe medication, reliable quality, and won the second prize of national technical invention and other scientific and technological awards; the new drug developed by Shuxinidine Phase II clinical trial; made important progress in lipid-lowering and anti-atherosclerosis research; published 60 academic papers, and trained 12 doctoral students, one of whom won the Excellence Award of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. </p>
  <p>In the study of cardiovascular pharmacological action and mechanism of salvianolate and its main components, it is the first to clarify that polyphenolate, which is mainly composed of magnesium salvia miltiorrhiza, is the most important active ingredient in Salvia miltiorrhiza. Dependent calcium channel block, protection of vascular endothelial cells, scavenging free radicals and other mechanisms and pathways play a role in protecting the cardiovascular system. On this basis, innovatively proposed the magnesium saponin magnesium acetate as the new drug quality control standard, and successfully developed the Danshen polyphenolate powder injection. It was found that the three components of Salvia miltiorrhiza polyphenolate magnesium acetate, sodium rosmarinate and magnesium oxalate inhibited the extracellular calcium influx and intracellular calcium release of vascular smooth muscle through different mechanisms, and regulated the [Ca2+]i dynamic balance of cells. . In the pharmacokinetic study of salvianolate, the main components of the drug were quantitatively analyzed, and the pharmacokinetic characteristics of these active compounds were clarified. The absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of the drug were systematically completed. In July 2005, Danshen polyphenolate powder injection was awarded the new drug certificate and production approval issued by the State Food and Drug Administration. The related technology has the invention patent authorization. The result was included in the demonstration project of modernization of traditional Chinese medicine by the National Development and Reform Commission, and was rated as the most competitive medical product by the Chinese pharmaceutical industry. It was awarded the first prize of 2007 Shanghai Science and Technology Invention and the second prize of 2011 National Technology Invention. And the 2013 China Academy of Sciences Outstanding Science and Technology Achievement Award. Since it was put into production in 2006, it has created huge social and economic benefits. In 2013, sales exceeded 3 billion yuan. This achievement has a significant promotion, demonstration and driving effect on the modernization of Chinese medicine, especially the injection of traditional Chinese medicine. </p>
  <p>In the study of the innovative drug sulphonate, it has been found to inhibit sodium, potassium and calcium channels in cardiomyocytes, and is a complex ion channel blocker. This new mechanism allows drugs to be used. Safer and more effective antiarrhythmic effect. The drug has been granted invention patents in China, the United States, Germany, France, Switzerland, Italy and Japan. In the preclinical pharmacodynamic study of sulphonate sulfate, a variety of experimental arrhythmia models were used to evaluate the efficacy of the drug, indicating that the drug is a safe and effective antiarrhythmic drug, which is expected to develop into a new and powerful drug. Anti-arrhythmia drugs, the project has signed a technology transfer and cooperative development agreement. The sulphate sulphate tablets have been approved by the State Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) for clinical trials of new drugs. Phase I clinical trials have shown that healthy subjects are well tolerated by the drug and are currently undergoing Phase II clinical trials</p >
