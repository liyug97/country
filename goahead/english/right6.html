		<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the report of the Seventeenth Congress of the CPC put forward the "theoretical system of socialism with Chinese characteristics", some new questions need to be answered. For example, why does not Mao Zedong Thought be included in the definition of this theoretical system? What's the explanation for the old saying "Beginning with Mao, Becoming with Deng"? Wait. Here is my personal opinion. In my view, three issues need to be clarified:<br><br>

One is about the time limit of modern China and contemporary China. The "theoretical system of socialism with Chinese characteristics" is not only a theoretical concept, but also a historical concept, that is, there is a problem of defining the historical time limit of contemporary China. There are different opinions on how to divide modern China, modern China and contemporary China into three periods. Because the understanding of it will change with the development of history. For example, the upper limit of "modern China" has been determined since the "Opium War" in 1840. When is its lower limit? It was set before the May 4th Movement in 1919. In recent years, historians believe that it should be before the founding of New China in 1949. So how to fix the time for "modern China"? If the lower limit of "modern China" is before the founding of the People's Republic of China, the upper limit will undoubtedly start from the founding of the People's Republic of China. What about its lower limit? First of all, there is the question of whether to divide modern China from contemporary China. Different scholars have different opinions. "Contemporary China" is a concept with relatively high utilization rate at present, which is also used in many places in the report of the Seventeenth National Congress. I am in favor of distinguishing the two.<br><br>

In my opinion, the time limit division between "modern China" and "contemporary China" is the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Party. According to the important documents since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee is regarded as a boundary to divide the history after the founding of the People's Republic. Comrade Xiaoping pointed out as early as March 1979 that the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee is a great turning point in our history and the beginning of a new stage of historical development. The report of the Seventeenth National Congress also points out that in 1978, the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee held by our Party had great historical significance, which opened a new historical period of reform and opening up. Therefore, the time limit for this dating is clear. If we admit that the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee is the lower limit of "modern China" and the historical starting point of "contemporary China".<br><br>

Socialism with Chinese characteristics is a historical concept with specific connotations. The report of the Thirteenth National Congress pointed out that after the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, our Party "began to find a way to build socialism with Chinese characteristics and opened up a new stage of socialist construction". Since it is the "new stage of socialist construction" of "starting" and "opening up", the historical starting point of "socialism with Chinese characteristics" is the new period of the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee. That is to say, "socialism with Chinese characteristics" is "contemporary China" socialism. Comrade Hu Jintao's report identifies its tense in the same way. The report opens with a clear statement of "banner" that "the great banner of socialism with Chinese characteristics is the banner of contemporary China's development and progress". When reviewing the 29-year historical achievements since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, it also refers to the theoretical system of socialism with Chinese characteristics as "contemporary Chinese Marxism". The report also points out that the establishment of the basic socialist system, the great achievements of the socialist revolution and construction in New China have laid a fundamental political prerequisite and institutional foundation for all development and progress in contemporary China. This shows that the time limit of "contemporary China" has been determined by the Seventeenth National Congress. Since there is such a clear distinction, speaking of contemporary China's socialist theory can only be the theory of socialism with Chinese characteristics since the reform and opening up.<br><br>

The second is about the connotation of the basic theory and innovation theory of Sinicized Marxism. Marxism is a grand theoretical system. As far as the theory is concerned, Mao Zedong Thought, Deng Xiaoping Theory and the important thought of "Three Represents" are all included, and they constitute the Chinese-style Marxism. In the past 86 years, the major theoretical achievements of the Sinicization of Marxism can be distinguished into basic theory and innovative theory according to the two historic leaps achieved. As the theoretical achievement of the first leap, Mao Zedong Thought, is the basic theory of Sinicized Marxism; as the theoretical achievement of the second leap, Deng Xiaoping Theory and the important thought of "Three Representatives" are the innovative theory of Sinicized Marxism.<br><br>

Why is this distinction made? Because their understanding of what socialism is and how to build socialism is similar and different. The Central Leading Group, with Comrade Mao Zedong as its core, has put forward many good and better ideas on how to build socialism, such as correctly handling contradictions among the people, which have been discussed in the Second Historical Resolution. However, the theory of building socialism in Mao Zedong Thought is not systematic and complete, because the question of what socialism is and how to build socialism is not fully understood. The first generation of Central Leadership Collectives explored the road of socialist construction suitable for China's situation. Although they had a good start around the Eighth National Congress of the Party, they did not find it in the end. Since the theoretical system of socialism with Chinese characteristics refers to the innovation theory of contemporary China, Mao Zedong Thought, as a basic theory, is not included. Of course, not including does not mean that it is not important. It is still the guiding ideology that our Party must adhere to.<br><br>

Since Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics was put forward in the 14th National Congress, although there is no clear distinction between basic theory and innovative theory, this distinction actually exists. The fourteenth report points out that the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics is Marxism in contemporary China. "To learn from Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, the central content is to learn the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics." The report of the 15th National Congress also pointed out that "to adhere to Deng Xiaoping Theory is to truly adhere to Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought." When the report of the Seventeenth National Congress talked about the "theoretical system of socialism with Chinese characteristics", it said that it "adhered to and developed Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought" and "was the latest achievement of the localization of Marxism in China". These are based on the distinction between basic theory and innovation theory, and there is a relationship between them. It is precisely this logic that defines the theoretical system of socialism with Chinese characteristics.<br><br>

Third, the origin of Mao Zedong Thought and the theory of socialism with Chinese characteristics. This means that Mao Zedong Thought is the origin theory of the theory of socialism with Chinese characteristics, not the origin theory.<br><br>

The so-called Mao Zedong Thought is the origin theory of the theory of socialism with Chinese characteristics, that is, the theory of socialism with Chinese characteristics is the inheritance and development of Mao Zedong Thought. Comrade Xiaoping once said, "In many ways, we are still doing what Comrade Mao Zedong has proposed but has not done, correcting his objections and doing well what he has not done well. For a long time to come, we should still do it. Of course, we also have development, but also continue to develop. It is based on this understanding that socialism with Chinese characteristics began with Mao and became Deng after the 1980s. It should be pointed out that before putting forward the theory of socialist market economy as the core theory of socialism with Chinese characteristics, this statement reflected the historical reality and the level of understanding at that time. However, since the theory of socialist market economy was put forward, there have been other innovative theories. As Lenin pointed out, "Our whole view of socialism has changed fundamentally". Since there have been great changes in the understanding of the theory of socialism with Chinese characteristics, it is necessary to make a concrete analysis of the statement that "starting from Mao". If our Party puts forward the idea of combining Marxism-Leninism with China's reality and finding a socialist construction road suitable for China's situation, that is to say, from the perspective of methodology of guiding ideology, we can continue to say that socialism with Chinese characteristics "begins with Mao". However, it is difficult to say that socialism with Chinese characteristics "started from Mao" in terms of a series of innovative theories put forward today, especially after the implementation of a set of principles and policies marked by the socialist market economy. After all, that statement is the understanding of the last century, and it is normal to revise some of them according to the development of history.

[The Important Thought of the Three Representatives] [Scientific Outlook on Development]<br><br>

On September 1, 1982, Deng Xiaoping stressed in his opening speech to the Twelfth National Congress of the Communist Party that our modernization must proceed from China's reality. Regardless of revolution or construction, we should pay attention to learning from foreign experience. However, copying other countries'experiences and models has never been successful. We have learned a lot in this respect. Combining the universal truth of Marxism with the concrete reality of our country, taking our own road and building socialism with Chinese characteristics are the basic conclusions we draw from our long-term historical experience. This is the first time that Deng Xiaoping put forward and used the concept of "building socialism with Chinese characteristics".<br><br>

In 1987, the Thirteenth National Congress of the Communist Party of China systematically expounded the basic outline of Deng Xiaoping's theory, clearly pointed out that China is in the primary stage of socialism, summarized and comprehensively expounded the basic line of the Party's "one center and two basic points", and determined six long-term guiding principles for building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and made it clear that China is in the primary stage of socialism. The strategic goal of "three steps" in China's modernization construction is indeed put forward.<br><br>

In October 1992, the 14th National Congress of the Party established Deng Xiaoping's guiding position in building socialism with Chinese characteristics. The amendments to the Party Constitution adopted by the General Assembly include the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the basic line of the Party in the primary stage of socialism.<br><br>

In September 1997, the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party officially put forward and used the concept of Deng Xiaoping Theory and put it into the Party Constitution as the guiding ideology of the Party.<br><br>

[Important Thought of the Three Representatives]<br><br>

In February 2000, Jiang Zemin put forward the important thought of "Three Represents" when he was visiting Guangdong. On the basis of grasping the general trend of world development and the profound changes of Chinese society, and summing up the historical experience of the International Communist Movement and the Communist Party of China, the important thought of "Three Representatives" further answered the questions of what socialism is and how to build socialism, and creatively answered the questions of what kind of Party to build. How to build the Party.<br><br>

In November 2002, the 16th National Congress of the Communist Party of China defined the important thought of "Three Representatives" as the guiding ideology of the Party.<br><br>

[Scientific Outlook on Development]<br><br>

Since the 16th National Congress, the CPC Central Committee, with Hu Jintao as its general secretary, has scientifically examined the new trends of the changes in the international situation, carefully analyzed the stage characteristics of China's development, thoroughly summarized the development experience of China and other countries in the world, and put forward the scientific development concept of people-oriented, comprehensive, coordinated and sustainable development and the construction of a socialist harmonious society. Major strategic thinking. In response to such important theoretical and practical questions as "what kind of development to achieve" and "how to develop", the author has made a response that is consistent with the basic principles of Marxism and has distinct characteristics of the times.<br>

Conclusion:<br><br>

It is a major theory of the Seventeenth National Congress to unify the innovative achievements and the latest achievements of the Sinicization of Marxism put forward by our Party at different stages since the reform and opening-up, Deng Xiaoping Theory, the important thought of "Three Representatives" and the scientific concept of development into a theoretical system of socialism with Chinese characteristics for the first time. Highlights. The times are developing, the practice is changing, and the objective process of building socialism with Chinese characteristics is generating new situations, new problems and new contradictions at all times, thus presenting a stage-by-stage feature. Although our Party once used Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics to summarize the results of the initial establishment of this theoretical system, Deng Xiaoping's theory is not the whole of this system. Generations of Chinese Communists have always shouldered the historical responsibility of not only upholding this theory, but also adapting to the changes and innovations of the objective reality.<br></p>
