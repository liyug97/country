In this regard, how should we grasp this judgment?<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through further analysis, we can see that the report of the 16th National Congress has also mentioned this issue of effectiveness, but from the perspective of "overall strengthening of Party building", while the difference of the report of the 17th National Congress is summarized from the level of "theoretical innovation and effective theoretical armed forces".<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, whether the effectiveness of anti-corruption is obvious depends not only on eliminating a number of corrupt elements or investigating several major cases, but also on the maturity of relevant theories. For a political party, theoretical maturity is the basis and prerequisite for political maturity.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From this point of view, the achievements of relevant theories in this regard are all significant manifestations of the achievements of the Party's work style, clean government construction and anti-corruption struggle. Of course, there are many theoretical achievements in this field, including the following aspects:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New Idea: Power Restriction and Supervision<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concept of restricting and supervising power has been formed. The concept here refers to the rational understanding and value orientation of the struggle against corruption. Now it seems that corruption is closely related to abuse of power. However, before the reform and opening-up, the Party's analysis of the causes of corruption is often limited to the influence of the exploiting class, especially the bourgeoisie, and greatly ignores the corrosive side of power itself. After the reform and opening up, the Party has a new understanding of the root causes of corruption. It not only sees the corruption caused by the exploiting class, but also sees the lack of factors restricting power. As Comrade Hu Jintao said at the Seventh Plenary Session of the Central Discipline Commission, "History and reality show that unrestricted power inevitably leads to corruption. Now, in some places and areas, corruption is prohibited repeatedly. One important reason is the lack of effective restriction and supervision of power.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New Measures: Establishment of Rules and Regulations<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More attention should be paid to the establishment and improvement of various rules and regulations. For a long time in the past, our Party has not fully understood the importance of the legal system and system. In the construction of a clean and honest Party style and anti-corruption, it mainly relies on the subjective factors such as the ideological awareness of Party members and cadres. Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, especially after Deng Xiaoping put forward the fundamental, overall, stable and long-term nature of the system problem, it has become the consensus of the whole Party to attach importance to the legal system and system construction.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the 16th National Congress, Party committees and people's congresses at all levels, from the central to local levels, have formulated a large number of laws and regulations on combating corruption and strengthening supervision. For example, our Party promulgated the Regulations on the Supervision within the Party of the Communist Party of China (for trial implementation), and constructed the basic framework for the development of the supervision within the Party. Its core idea is to carry out the supervision within the Party with the development of democracy within the Party as the main line, with the operation of power as the key object, and with the system as the basis.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New ideas: no longer limited to ideological education and mass movements<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clear the Party's style of work and clean government construction and anti-corruption ideas. Since the 16th National Congress, our Party's anti-corruption and honesty ideas have been developing in succession and enriching in innovation. From the perspective of the inherent law of combating corruption and promoting honesty, we should establish and improve the system of punishment and prevention of corruption that is compatible with the socialist market economic system, paying equal attention to education, system and supervision; from the perspective of the ruling party's own construction, we should adhere to the concept of scientific development and focus on the ruling party and society. From the perspective of the overall layout of the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics, we should integrate anti-corruption work into the political, economic, cultural and social construction and promote the all-round development of society.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, this thinking reflects the deepening of the Party's understanding of the anti-corruption law, the construction law of the ruling party and the law of social development, while the previous anti-corruption thinking is mostly limited to ideological education and mass movements.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New Experience: Affection for People's Livelihood and Formation of Joint Force<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This paper summarizes the basic experience of building a clean and honest Party style and anti-corruption. Being good at summing up experience is our Party's fine tradition. Over the past 50 years in power, our Party has always attached great importance to the construction of a clean and honest Party style and anti-corruption work as a major political task of the whole Party and accumulated many valuable experiences. Among them, there are six basic experiences: First, we must adhere to the leadership of the Communist Party of China to ensure opposition and harmony. The correct direction of preventing corruption; second, we must keep pace with the times in guiding ideology and use developing Marxism to guide the new practice of building a clean and honest Party style and anti-corruption work; third, we must closely focus on the development of the Party's first priority of governing and rejuvenating the country, in order to build a well-off society in an all-round way and accelerate socialist modernization. Fourthly, we must persist in establishing the Party for the public and governing for the people, and effectively correct the unhealthy tendencies harming the interests of the masses. Fifthly, we must deepen reform, innovate the system and mechanism, and pay attention to preventing and solving corruption from the source. Sixthly, we must adhere to and improve the anti-corruption leadership mechanism and working mechanism to form anti-corruption. The overall force of struggle.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New Strategy: Focusing on Solving Deep-seated Problems<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strategic policy of combating corruption and promoting honesty is put forward. With the deepening of anti-corruption work, our Party recognizes that in the long run, anti-corruption and anti-corruption work must treat both symptoms and symptoms, and comprehensively manage them. We should not only punish them well, but also pay attention to prevention and solve the problem of corruption from the source. The Fourth Plenary Session of the Sixteenth Central Committee, on the basis of scientific summary of our Party's practical experience in combating corruption and advocating honesty, made innovations, and put forward the 16-character strategic policy of "treating both symptoms and symptoms, comprehensive management, punishment and prevention simultaneously, and paying attention to prevention". This strategic policy focuses on the perfection and perfection of the management system and supervision and restriction mechanism that are compatible with the socialist market economic system, and on solving some deep-seated problems that lead to corruption. It reflects the strategic, overall and fundamental considerations of the current and future anti-corruption work. As long as we adhere to this strategic policy, we can achieve new results in the anti-corruption work under the new situation.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New Decision-making: Constructing the Punishment and Prevention System of "Not Wanting to Corrupt, Not Corrupt"<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strategic decision to establish and improve the system of punishment and prevention of corruption has been made. The Party Central Committee has promulgated the Outline for Implementing the System of Punishment and Prevention of Corruption, which lays equal stress on education, system and supervision. It has put forward the guiding ideology, main objectives and working principles of establishing the system of punishment and prevention of corruption. This system consists of three parts: education, system and supervision, including punishment and prevention. Among them, education is the foundation, focusing on enlightenment, focusing on solving ideological and moral defense line and "not wanting corruption" to solve the motive of corruption is the premise of system and supervision; system is the guarantee, focusing on norms, devoting itself to the defense line of Party discipline and state law, so as to solve the opportunity problem of corruption. Education and supervision is the basis; supervision is the key, focusing on supervision, committed to restraint and punishment, so as not to dare corruption, in order to solve the cost of corruption, is the implementation of education and system measures. They lay equal stress on each other, depend on each other and promote each other, and are unified in the practice of anti-corruption and advocating honesty.
