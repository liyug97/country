			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2012, the party's "big eighteen again clear:" to promote the development of cultural industry rapidly, to build a well-off society in an all-round way in 2020, the cultural industry become a pillar industry of national economy."
		    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With reference to a decade ago, the national policy on real estate industry's frequent guidance, can clear the similarity of history. Cultural industry has no suspense became the property after the "national economic pillar industries" successor. History, why choose "culture industry".
			  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, it is "domestic demand".

			  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Power is the only one like Chinese culture, has a rich and huge culture and art assets, as well as powerful and contemporary culture and art creativity, accumulation and accumulated very substantial industry strength.
			  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the one hand, the cultural art assets need to "activate", need an export into productivity and profits, release it to the accumulation of power. On the other hand, in the transformation and upgrading of traditional industries, science and technology innovation and cultural creativity become the key factor, and this factor is pregnant in supported by creative force and the creativity of cultural industry.
			  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the fact certificate high expanding emerging economy, often gathers at the light property, the high added value industrial domain, the cultural industry happen to conforms to this characteristic. 
			  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the "external demand".
			  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;China passes through the high speed economical development, at the same time which the wealth rises suddenly, the national culture accomplishment has not obtained the effective promotion, internationally in the prestige, China needs the cultural image and the sound which matches with the economic output, needs “the national image” powerfully.From some time ago, practiced president line of the European multitudinous opinions, might see high-level to China “the cultural output” earnest expectation and urgent anticipation.In this sense, the cultural industry will be the future China “the national strategy”. 
			  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In cultural industry many branches, the artware industry is the creation accumulates richly, the industrial chain is simplest, transaction most nimble industry condition branch.In "about Financial backing Culture Industry Promotion And Development Prosperous Instruction Opinion" and "about Thorough Advancement Culture Finance Cooperation Opinion" under the document instruction, in 2009 “the artistic finance industry” the situation swift and violent development which sends thinly by the thick product. 
			  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Financial of art, is the art into financial instruments, with financial assets into individual and institutional management methods.
			  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its main forms are:
			  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. works of art property transactions;
			  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. the Arts Fund;
			  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. the arts bank & trust;
			  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. works of art mortgage and mortgage;
			  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. art rental and so on. At present, the mainstream of the market is securitized art property rights transactions and private placement of art funds.
			  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Future direction
			  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the best of times, but also the worst of times! Every era, there will be the era of unique imprint. Look at everything from the perspective of history, read the times, read the present, look for the law, seize the opportunity, in order to stabilize the tide of the times.
朗
			  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inevitable reason why the collection of cultural relics and works of art has become a common cause for many wealthy families is:
			  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, cultural art collection is the best choice to pass on the family context. Cultural relics and works of art can not only enjoy the eyes and dialogue with the soul, but also have historical, cultural and academic value, and at the same time embody the value orientation of the cultural concept of the parents.
			  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, art is an elegant identity card. The collection of works of art symbolizes a person's cultural taste and social status, is a passport to enter the high-level cultural circle.

			  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The achievement of the collection is not exactly the quantity and value of the collection, but also in the spirit and character of the collector. Collectors with personal funds, do their whole life's energy, accumulated over time, gathered into a tower, to themselves, to future generations, to the country left a valuable spiritual material wealth. It not only makes up for the shortcomings of the national cultural and cultural departments, protects history, and adds the source of cultural relics in the collection. The well-known collector Ma Weiwei, etc., has set up a private museum to share his own personal collection.</p>
