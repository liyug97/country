			<div class="word"><p align="left"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silk is a specialty of China. The ancient Chinese working people invented and mass-produced silk products. It also opened the first large-scale trade exchanges between the East and the West in world history. It is known as the Silk Road. Since the Western Han Dynasty, Chinese silk has been shipped abroad in large quantities and has become a world-famous product. In ancient times, silk was a textile made of silk(mainly mulberry silk, but also a small amount of silk and cassava silk). Due to the expansion of textile raw materials in modern times, all textiles woven with artificial or natural filament fibers can be called generalized silk. The silk woven by pure mulberry silk is also known as "true silk."</p></div>
