As the first central foreign affairs working conference held after the Nineteenth National Congress, the most important outcome of the conference was to establish the guiding position of Xi Jinping's diplomatic thought.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an important part of Xi Jinping's socialist thought with Chinese characteristics in the new era, Xi Jinping's diplomatic thought is the fundamental guideline for China's foreign work in the new era.</p>
		
		<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Essence of Xi Jinping's Diplomatic Thought
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Eighteenth National Congress of the CPC, the CPC Central Committee, with Comrade Xi Jinping as its core, has deeply grasped the development trend of China and the world in the new era, carried out a series of major theoretical and practical innovations in foreign work, and formed the socialist diplomatic thought with Chinese characteristics in the new era.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past five years, China's foreign work has "won many major battles and hard battles, accomplished many major difficulties and achieved historic achievements", which is based on the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as its core and the scientific guidance of Xi's diplomatic thoughts.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The essence of Xi Jinping's diplomatic thought includes 10 aspects:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should adhere to the principle of maintaining the authority of the Central Committee of the Party and strengthening the Party's centralized and unified leadership over foreign affairs, take the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation as our mission, promote the diplomacy of major powers with Chinese characteristics, promote the construction of a community of human destiny with the purpose of safeguarding world peace and promoting common development, and adhere to socialism with Chinese characteristics. We must enhance our strategic self-confidence and adhere to the principle of "sharing the same area and building together" to promote the construction of "one belt and one road". We must adhere to the road of peaceful development based on mutual respect and cooperation and win win. We must build a global partnership on the basis of deepening our diplomatic layout and adhere to the reform of global governance system guided by fairness and justice. To safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests with national core interests as the bottom line, and to shape a unique style of China's diplomacy in the direction of combining the fine traditions of foreign work with the characteristics of the times.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These 10 aspects, i.e. 10 "perseverance", are not only the grand design based on the whole world, but also the concrete measures of seeking truth and pragmatism. They are the profound theoretical and practical basis for the construction of the diplomacy of major powers with Chinese characteristics.</p>
		
		<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Establishing a Correct View of History, a View of the General Situation and a View of the Role
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To do a good job in foreign affairs, we must accurately grasp the international situation and the basic characteristics of our external environment.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, China is in the best period of development since modern times, and the world is in an unprecedented change in a century. Both of them are intertwined and mutually agitated. There are many favorable international conditions for doing a good job in foreign affairs at present and in the future.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, Xi Jinping pointed out that in order to grasp the international situation, we should establish a correct outlook on history, the overall situation and the role. What is the correct view of history, overall situation and role?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Correct historical outlook means not only looking at the current international situation, but also looking back at the past, summing up the laws of history, looking forward to the future and grasping the general trend of historical progress.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Correct overall outlook means not only seeing the phenomena and details, but also grasping the essence and the overall situation, grasping the main aspects of major contradictions and contradictions, and avoiding losing direction and losing the essence in the multifarious and changeable international chaos.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Correct view of role means not only calmly analyzing various international phenomena, but also putting ourselves in it, looking at problems in our relations with the world, clarifying our status and role in the evolution of the world pattern, and scientifically formulating our foreign policy.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What situations need to be grasped?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should not only grasp the trend of accelerating the world's multi-polarization, but also attach importance to the situation of deep adjustment of relations between major powers. We should not only grasp the trend of sustainable development of economic globalization, but also pay attention to the trend of profound evolution of the world economic pattern. We should not only grasp the overall stability of the international environment, but also attach importance to the complex situation of international security challenges. We should not only grasp the trend of exchanges and mutual learning among civilizations, but also attach importance to the reality that different ideologies and cultures interact with each other.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recognizing the international situation and setting up correct concepts, Xi Jinping used Marxist materialist dialectics to set up a guiding light for China's foreign work in the new era.</p>
		<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Key Points of Foreign Work in the New Era
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Nineteenth Congress to the Twentieth Congress of the Communist Party of China, it is the historical convergence period for realizing the goal of "two hundred years" struggle, and it is of special significance in the historical process of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. "We should thoroughly analyze the evolution law of the international situation in the transitional period of world transformation, accurately grasp the basic characteristics of China's external environment in the historical intersection period, and plan and promote foreign work as a whole."
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the focus of China's foreign work in the new era, this conference has sent a clear signal.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—— We should revolve around the important nodes of the Party's and the state's work and promote continuous innovation in foreign work. In the next five years, the first century's goal will be achieved, and the second century's goal will begin with a series of important time nodes and activities. Foreign work should take this as its coordinate, take overall consideration and advance step by step. It should not only lay out the overall layout but also highlight the key points. It should also be multi-point flowering and precise to exert its comprehensive positive effect.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—— We should hold high the banner of building a community of human destiny and promote the development of the global governance system in a more just and rational direction.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——We must continue to work together to build and share, and promote the construction of "one belt and one road" to go deep and steady, and push the opening to the outside world to a new level.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——We should make good use of the relations among major powers and promote the construction of a framework of relations among major powers with overall stability and balanced development.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——We need to do a good job in Peripheral Diplomacy and promote a friendlier and more favorable environment.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——We should deepen solidarity and cooperation with developing countries and promote a new situation of joint progress and common development. The vast number of developing countries are our natural allies in international affairs. We should adhere to the correct outlook on justice and interests and do a good job of uniting and cooperating with developing countries.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——We should further promote in-depth exchanges and mutual learning between China and the world.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——We should strengthen political awareness, overall situation awareness, core awareness and alignment awareness, resolutely safeguard the authority and centralized and unified leadership of the Party Central Committee, consciously maintain a high degree of consistency in Ideological and political action with the Party Central Committee, and ensure that orders and actions are prohibited and the pace is unified; we should strengthen overall coordination, with different emphasis and coordination, so as to form a comprehensive Party plan. The Bureau and the coordinating parties should work in a coordinated manner; we should build a foreign work force loyal to the Party, the country and the people, with firm politics, excellent business, strong style and strict discipline; and we should implement the reform of the foreign work system and mechanism in accordance with the unified deployment of the Party Central Committee.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the guidance of Xi Jinping's diplomatic thought, foreign diplomacy in the new era should firmly grasp the main line of serving the national rejuvenation and promoting human progress, so as to push the diplomacy of big powers with Chinese characteristics to a higher level with a larger goal, a broader pattern, a broader mind and a more calm manner.</p>
