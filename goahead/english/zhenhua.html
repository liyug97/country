</div>
<h2 class="h2"><span>2</span>Setting the background</h2>
<div class="content4"><br>
  <p>A few years before the establishment of Zhenhua Heavy Industry, it was to learn from foreigners to follow their footsteps, so that they can take fewer detours and enter the market with a high starting point. In the following years, I realized that this “imitation” production path could not stabilize the viability of the enterprise. Therefore, the “Technical Enthusiast” Zhenhua CEO Guan Yuxian proposed the product concept of “independent innovation” and led the production team to go on. R & D road, create their own excellent brand, with the development of their own scientific and technological strength of the new force, from ignorance to knowledge, from spontaneous to conscious, making ZPMC become the main force of the world crane market. </p>

<h2 class="h2"><span>3</span>Company Management</h2>
<div class="content5">
  <h2>Management mode</h2>
  <p>After April 9, 2008, after the Beijing Olympic torch relay was safely delivered in San Francisco, CNN "Current Affairs Forum" host Jack Cafferty attacked Chinese products and Chinese people on the show, causing strong protests from the nationals. . On the 18th, the first page of the Shanghai Zhenhua Port Machinery website published the article titled “40,000 employees of Zhenhua Port Machinery Co., Ltd.’s insult to the CNN host’s insulting speech” and jumped into the Chinese with the attitude of China’s protest against CNN’s first enterprise. Vision. The state-owned three-funded enterprise, which was founded in 1992 and mainly produces cranes and large steel bridge components, has so far created a miracle that accounts for 70% of the international port machinery market. Its rapid development in just 15 years, It has enriched the successful management of the invisible champions of many local companies. In order to explore its management background and successful experience, in 2007, the author, as a member of the “Chinese-style Enterprise Management Science Basic Research” led by the Development Research Center of the State Council, made a special trip to the company for research. </p>
</div>
<div class="content6">
  <h2>Management features</h2>
    <p>One of the features: Uncle KFC’s entrepreneurship started, and the eclectic approach of employing people</p>
    <p>As KFC’s uncle Harlan Sanders’s entrepreneurial experience in his later years, Guan Yuxian, 59, relied on the belief that the country’s rise and fall, the husband is responsible, and the industry’s great spring, in response to 1992. Comrade Deng Xiaoping’s call, with a wave of arms, led a dozen people to start
  Zhenhua Heavy Industry Busy Terminal
  Zhenhua Heavy Industry Busy Terminal
  Your own entrepreneurial journey. After more than 10 years of hard work, Zhenhua's influence on international large-scale lifting equipment is very important. Today, the Zhenhua team with tens of thousands of people, from the 20-year-old passionate young generation to more than 70 experienced old people, they are on the same heart, with great team cohesion, and strive to make Zhenhua a world-class crane industry. </p>
    <p>Zhenhua Heavy Industry believes in the employment of the "sages in place, capable people in service", and applies the core concept of "respecting knowledge and respecting talents" to the employment environment. Zhenhua replaced the boss construction team contracting system with the labor management company contracting system, and strived for the harmony of labor and capital relations to achieve the "win-win" status of labor and capital. He created the legend of turning migrant workers into industrial workers. Through the training of migrant workers, the establishment of incentives for husband and wife, etc., enabled migrant workers to consciously serve Zhenhua. In addition, its re-education is not only academically qualified, retirement is not based on age, and it is a series of measures for carving statues of scientific research, which cultivates and retains a large number of talents in production, design and management. </p>
    <p>Feature 2: The country is supreme, multi-functional tube shrinking machine, and rapidly promote foreign markets</p>
    <p>In 2002, General Secretary Hu Jintao approached San Francisco during his visit to the United States, which coincided with the passing of four “steel giants” through the Golden Gate Bridge. The top of the crane is only 30 centimeters below the bridge. It is prudent. The city of San Francisco temporarily closed the Golden Gate Bridge for 25 minutes, causing traffic jams in San Francisco. The crowds of people all walked to the banks to see the "fighter" Chinese cranes. President Hu Jintao’s team also stopped to let him know about it. American television also reported to the United States. </p>
    <p>In fact, this is just one example of Zhenhua Group’s glory for the country. Zhenhua's corporate culture contains a sense of great mission that requires employees to be patriotic and to rejuvenate the nation, to support people to overcome difficulties and to carry forward the spirit of patriotism. When Zhenhua products entered the German market, the German political circles experienced a process of blame and acceptance. When the four-class transport ship carrying the cranes produced in Hamburg, Germany, was driven on the Elbe River, the tourists rushed to this spectacular scene. A playground played the national anthem of the People’s Republic of China. The captain called the report: “I This year, I realized the dignity of being a Chinese. I have swept away the national inferiority wounds left by the Chinese nation in the 150 years since the powers of the great powers. </p>
    <p>Feature 3: Independent innovation is the killer of Zhenhua's success</p>
    <p>As the General Manager said: "We are in the whirlpool of competition, and we never dare to neglect technological innovation." The mechanism that motivates employees to innovate is the core secret weapon of the total. Under his leadership, ZPMC has its own research and development platform. In order to encourage technological innovation, Zhenhua Port Machinery invests 5% of its annual output value in scientific research. In 2005, it invested nearly 200 million yuan. The company also awarded 10 million yuan each year to reward engineers and technicians with outstanding contributions. The highest prize is 1 million yuan. The company has a strong research team. More than 600 of the company's 1,500 management personnel are R&D personnel, with 105 masters and 153 senior engineers. The company attaches great importance to the use of “outside brain” and extensively with Shanghai Jiaotong University and Tongji University. More than 200 domestic and foreign universities and professional research institutions, such as Shanghai Maritime University, Wuhan University of Technology, China Ship Science Research Center, and American Lif Tank Company, have mobilized them to help analyze and solve technical problems. </p>
    <p>In 1998, the management organization’s professional staff developed control software that allowed the bridge and GPS to operate in a coordinated manner within a few months, enabling the field bridge that had to be visually operated by the driver in the seven-eight-height cab. Only 1 meter of clearance in the flexible shuttle, the error is less than 15 mm.
  </p>
    <p>In April 2002, ZPMC developed the “Double Car Coast Bridge” successfully into the port of Hamburg, Germany, which is known for its technical requirements. It has won more than US$300 million in revenue. </p>
    <p>Zhenhua's corporate strategy of focusing on innovative talent development and new product development has enabled them to cross the path that the world's peers have traveled for thirty or forty years in fourteen years. Their performance shows the wisdom and diligence of the Chinese, and the well-known opponents in the world heavy machinery industry have only been able to fight in the international competition bidding. </p>
    <p>Feature 4: Respect and commitment is the credo of ZPMC</p>
    <p>Because of the young and inexperienced, the products of Zhenhua Port Machinery have also experienced many flaws. However, the company has never been able to decorate the door. For example, the design of the gearbox for the export of Oman is not appropriate. The company is determined to replace all 40 gearboxes at a time and has won praises from users. For another example, they have recommended the German Doytz diesel engine. The initial use is still good, but there have been many problems. Although the warranty period has passed, it still bears the responsibility and will replace the damaged parts with new ones. In the matching of the products, Zhenhua encourages the use of China's customs clearance parts, and bears the responsibility for quality. Due to the ZPMC speaking count, the user has been convinced that in the US market, container bridges have been used that fully use Chinese electromechanical components. In terms of delivery time, due to the large-scale machinery involved in various aspects, there are many processes, especially the whole sea transportation is very difficult. Zhenhua owns six 60,000-ton ship transport vessels, which can guarantee on-time delivery. In order to get products on time, the Vancouver Port of Canada and the Port of Oakland, USA, have identified ZPMC and awarded Zhenhua a new contract five times. </p>
    <p>Five features: capture opportunities, develop advantages, and have a discerning strategic vision</p>
    <p>Not only did Zhenhua uniquely choose this right strategic market at the beginning of its business, but in the present and future years, can ZPMC develop new growth points and open up more attractive markets? The answer is yes. </p>
    <p>In the total volume of international cargo transportation, 80% of the goods are transported by sea. Bulk cargo transportation such as coal and ore has the same huge market as container transportation. As early as 2004, the company started to enter the bulk cargo loading and unloading market. With ZPMC's dominance and network in the field of container machinery, it has quickly become the most important domestically. Bulk machinery suppliers, and initially opened up the international market. In 2005, sales of bulk machinery had reached one-tenth of total sales. </p>
    <p>With the shortage of energy, the pace of offshore oilfield exploitation has increased, and the demand for large floating cranes at sea has increased. ZMPC is developing the world's first 7,000-ton floating crane, which has attracted worldwide attention. CNOOC ordered offshore oil production pipe-laying vessels are also producing. in. According to Dong Hengrui, senior economist of ZPMC, the annual purchase of offshore heavy machinery in the world market is estimated to be more than 50 billion US dollars, which is even larger than the container machinery market. </p>
    <p>In October 2006, when California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger led a delegation to conduct a business visit to China, Guan Yuxian seized the opportunity to become the main subcontractor of the $4.7 billion steel structure of the California Bridge. After the door of the world's large steel bridge market, shortly afterwards, it received orders for 10,000 tons in South Korea's Busan and Incheon Steel Structure Bridges. </p>
    <p>"My strength is steel structure, I will not get involved in industries where I have no advantage." Guan Yuxian said that he recently considered the most how to develop bulk machinery and offshore heavy duty in addition to maintaining the dominance of container machinery. Machinery, large steel structure bridges and port machinery parts production and other related industries form a complete industrial chain. </p>

  <div class="content8">
    <h2>Management Review</h2>
    <p>Return to the management characteristics of Zhenhua Heavy Industry Group, we evaluated it from the following aspects:</p>
    <p>1. The background and experience of Zhenhua President has profound implications for the construction of corporate culture, resulting in good corporate performance</p>
    <p>The company was founded 15 years ago, and Guan Yuxian is still in a state of entrepreneurship. I have to ask why, because I am afraid of his strong patriotic feelings. More than 20 years ago, he served as deputy director of the Plant Division of the Department of Water Transport of the Ministry of Communications. At that time, domestic port cranes were imported from abroad at high prices, and many were second-hand goods. Domestic production companies are not arguing. Due to lack of design experience and low production levels, the products produced are not as good as foreign ones. </p>
    <p>"You didn't see the arrogance of foreigners, and they looked down on us." The huge gap ignited his fighting spirit. At the age of 59, Guan Yixian, who was about to retire, resolutely went to sea to start a business. He took the company with the name of Shanghai Zhenhua Port Machinery Co., Ltd. </p>
    <p>Since then, "patriotism" has become an indispensable part of the company's corporate culture. According to the guidance of this concept, the company has become bigger and stronger, creating a well-known Chinese brand recognized by the world container machinery market. . </p>
    <p>From this point of view, the impact of the CEO on the company is indispensable. </p>
    <p>2. Target market positioning is in place</p>
    <p>Large container machinery is a combination of high technology and labor intensive products. The first world needs it, but because of the high labor costs, manufacturers such as the United States, Japan, and Germany are increasingly losing market competitiveness. Although many manufacturers in the third world have low-cost labor, they do not have high technology, so they cannot do it. This kind of product is most suitable for our production in a country with high technology and low labor costs. Therefore, Zhenhua selected this market. With the accurate positioning of the target market and the effective management mode of the company, Zhenhua Port Machinery has developed rapidly. </p>
    <p>3. The geographical background of Zhenhua Heavy Industry, which opens up the market</p>
    <p>When the company started its business, it chose Shanghai as the resident of Zhenhua Port Machinery. Shanghai is an international metropolis, and now it has become the economic center of our country. In this open and competitive environment, countless entrepreneurs and investors have invested their energy in this hot spot. </p>
    <p>It is true that from the international background of Shanghai and the good relationship between government and enterprises, the pressure test blasting detector, Zhenhua Port Machinery can open up its overseas market and gain huge profits. Overseas companies are also very happy to cooperate with Chinese companies in the Shanghai context. They may know Shanghai better than the mainland and understand the industrial structure of the coastal areas. </p>
    <p>Formally based on cooperation with the Shanghai Municipal Government, Zhenhua Port Machinery has established the Changxing Base, the world's largest crane development and production base, the 3.5 km coastline of Shanghai Zhenhua Port Machinery. </p>
    <p>4. Accurate grasp of the international market</p>
    <p>Open a map of the world and find out a few important ports without the "ZMPC" logo? The answer is no. Today, the world's famous ports, from Vancouver, Canada to Long Beach in the United States, from Santos, Brazil to Hamburg, Germany, from Amsterdam, the Netherlands to Adelaide, Australia, can see Zhenhua Port Machinery. Up to now, Zhenhua has become a recognized leader in the global industry with its technological advantages created by innovation. Its products have successfully entered 150 ports in 38 countries and Taiwan and Hong Kong. Zhenhua's choice, advancement and deepening of the international market are also necessary conditions for its success. </p>
    <p>It’s no wonder that Zhenhua Heavy Industry created a spectacular scene in the San Francisco New Bay Bridge in the United States. It’s no wonder that General Secretary Hu Jintao’s message of “bigger and stronger” when inspecting Zhenhua Port Machinery, Zhenhua Port Machinery gave us China. The management model of the enterprise provides a good example of success. It is believed that many domestic enterprises will seek their own management mode under their own exploration, so as to obtain longer-term enterprise development. </p>
