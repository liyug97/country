		<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 70 years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, have made great strides and written an epic struggle with a sense of the world. In the 70 years of turmoil, the Chinese nation has ushered in a great leap from standing up and getting rich to becoming strong. It is walking proudly on the road to realizing the Chinese dream of great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. History has witnessed the great changes in New China, and it also bears the valuable experience of continuing to advance and the bright hope of welcoming the future. General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out: "History is the best textbook and the best awakening agent. Today, we are closer, more confident and capable than at any other time in history of achieving the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. "Talking about the past, thinking," records, studies, and explains the history of the People's Republic of China. It is not only conducive to performing well to demonstrate the development and progress of contemporary China and the wonderful life of contemporary Chinese people, but also to explain the Chinese spirit, Chinese values, and Chinese power. It also helps to extract the internal laws of development and change from the 70 years of struggle, so as to absorb the rich nutrition and inexhaustible power, and jointly welcome the magnificent dawn of national rejuvenation.</p>

		<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;，The May 4th Movement, which broke out a hundred years ago, was a great patriotic revolutionary movement against imperialism and feudalism, a great ideological liberation movement and a new cultural movement. The May 4th Movement promoted the spread of Marxism in China and prepared the conditions for the establishment of the Communist Party of China. This opened the prelude to the Chinese new democratic revolution. The May 4th Movement was also the beginning of the modern Chinese youth movement. It was during the May 4th Movement that Chinese youth entered the historical stage as a new force. The May 4th Movement left us with a valuable spiritual wealth. This is the spirit of patriotism, progress, democracy and science. The spirit of the May 4th Movement has always inspired generations of Chinese youth to continue to advance, develop, and innovate. The times are developing, the society is progressing, and the spirit of May 4th is constantly enriching and developing. We ourselves are striving to practice "learning, seeking truth, seeking truth" and "being kind to others and being kind to life" as the principle of doing things. To seek knowledge, truth, and truth, we are required to remember the duty of seeking truth and being pragmatic. Moreover, we must be meticulous and meticulous, always maintain a positive and enterprising spirit, overcome complacency, strive to cultivate their own creative capabilities, develop their creative potential, do real things well, and do good things.</p>
