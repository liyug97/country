<h2 class="h2"><span>2</span>Architectural Design</h2>
<div class="content4"><br>
  <h2>Building Structure</h2>
  <li>Overall layout</li>
  <p>The Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge consists of three navigation bridges, one submarine tunnel, four artificial islands and connecting bridge tunnels, non-compassing continuous beam bridges in deep and shallow water areas and land links of Hong Kong, Zhuhai and Macao. Among them, the three navigation bridges are Qingzhou Waterway Bridge, Jianghai Direct Ship Channel Bridge and Jiuzhou Waterway Bridge from east to west; the submarine tunnel is located between Lantau Island and Qingzhou Waterway Bridge in Hong Kong, connecting other bridge sections through east and west artificial islands; The non-navigable continuous beam bridges in the water area are located in the near Hong Kong waters and near the Zhuhai waters; the three ports and their artificial islands are located near the approach bridges at both ends, and the main roads are connected by connecting lines. </p>
  <li>Design Ideas</li>
  <p>The overall design concept of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge includes strategic, innovative, functional, safety, environmental, cultural and landscape aspects. </p>
  <p>The main bridge of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge is three large-span steel-stayed cable-stayed bridges, each with its own unique artistic conception. Among them, the Qingzhou Waterway Bridge Tower's top knot supports the “Chinese knot” cultural element, and “curve” the original right angle and straight line shape, making the bridge tower smart, delicate and elegant. The main tower tower shape of the Jianghai Direct Ship Channel Bridge is taken from the “White Dolphin” element and combined with the marine culture of the Dolphin Reserve. The main tower of Jiuzhou Waterway Bridge is taken from the "sail", which means "sailing and sailing", and it has a serialized effect with the river and the direct navigation of the ship's navigation channel. The overall design of the pylon is strong, with strong affinity, and has a strong landmark. The east and west artificial islands take the "mussel" element, which means that the Qinhai Hengqin Island is rich in mussels. The overall design of the Hong Kong port is innovative, aesthetically pleasing and energy efficient. The berthing building is designed with a wavy canopy to support the canopy. The pillars of the building are tree-shaped, with a conical shape at the bottom and a twig-like top. The toll station closest to Zhuhai City is designed in a curved shape with a steel column in front and several steel cables behind it, like a huge anchor. The height difference between the water and the underwater part of the bridge is nearly 100 meters. It has both a horizontal curve and a vertical height. The whole is as thin and light as a ribbon, and the multiple nodes are strung together, meaning "beads and joints." The Qianshanhe Bridge adopts the prestressed composite box girder scheme of corrugated steel webs. It adopts the sky blue painting scheme that conforms to the green ecological characteristics. The shape is light and beautiful, and the natural ecological landscape of the area is utterly awkward; the bridge body is light and healthy, like Changhong lying wave. The sky-blue corrugated web and the front mountain river channel are like each other, like a water and sky, forming a beautiful landscape between the wind and the clouds. </p>
  <li>Design Features</li>
  <p>For the demanding requirements of “low water resistance rate”, “water and land transportation three-dimensional traffic lines do not interfere with each other”, “environmental protection” and “traffic safety”, the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge adopts “bridge, island and tunnel trinity”. The construction form; the entire section of the bridge is S-shaped curve, the axial direction of the pier and the flow direction of the water flow are roughly leveled, which can alleviate the driver's driving fatigue, reduce the water blocking rate of the pier and improve the architectural beauty. </p>
  <p>The cable-stayed bridge has the advantages of large spanning capacity, beautiful shape, good wind resistance, quick and convenient construction, good economic benefits, etc. It is often one of the preferred bridge types for large bridges across the sea. In combination with the economic and aesthetics of bridge construction and the requirements of navigation level, the three navigation bridges of the main bridge of Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge are all cable-stayed bridges, which are super high by 8 to 23 tons and 1860 MPa. The strength parallel steel wire giant cable-stayed cable is stretched from about 3,000 tons of self-weight main tower to bear about 7000 tons of beam surface; the whole bridge has the characteristics of large span, high pylon and strong structural stability. </p>
</div>
<div class="content5">
    <h2>Design parameters</h2>
    <p>The Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge is 55 kilometers long, including 22.9 kilometers of bridge works and 6.7 kilometers of undersea tunnels. The tunnels are connected by two artificial islands, east and west; 224 bridge piers and 7 bridge towers; bridge width 33.1 meters, the length of the immersed tunnel is 5664 meters, the width is 28.5 meters, the net height is 5.1 meters; the maximum longitudinal slope of the bridge is 3%, the bridge cross slope is 2.5%, the tunnel pavement is 1.5%; the bridge is driven by the two-way six-lane highway. Highway standard construction, design speed of 100 km / h, the entire line of bridge and culvert design car load grade is highway-I grade, bridge deck total pavement area of ​​700,000 square meters; navigation bridge and tunnel meets the recent 100,000 tons, long-term 300,000 tons of tankers Passage; the design life of the bridge is 120 years, which can withstand the magnitude 8 earthquake, 16 typhoon, 300,000 tons of impact and the 300-year flood of the Pearl River Estuary. </p>
</div>
<h2 class="h2"><span>3</span>Equipment implementation</h2>
<div class="content6"><br>
  <p>The Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge traffic project includes 12 subsystems including toll collection, communication, monitoring, lighting, fire protection, power supply, water supply and drainage, and lightning protection. </p>
  <li>Pavement</li>
  <p>The service life standard of the asphalt concrete pavement of Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge is 15 years. The asphalt concrete is about 7 cm thick and is divided into two layers of pouring layer and surface layer, of which 3 cm of pouring asphalt is an important component. The part of the asphalt is a natural lake bottom asphalt imported from abroad, which is made of stone mixed with different proportions of asphalt; the pores are small, the water will not corrode the steel plate, and the steel plate is formed with secondary protection; the synergistic deformation ability is good, and the steel box can be used along with the steel box The beam is synchronously deformed and bonded to the upper layer of ordinary asphalt; when it is laid, it is stirred by the mixer while heating, so that the temperature is not lower than 230 °C. </p>
  <li>Lighting</li>
  <p>The whole night illumination of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge is divided into two parts: functional lighting and decorative lighting. Dozens of color-changing LED floodlights are placed around each of the three navigational bridges, and the façade of the main tower is illuminated by narrow beam projection. The cable-stay night lighting uses narrow-beam color-changing LED floodlights to track and illuminate each cable, not only to outline the shape, but also to show the tension of the cable and the rhythm of the strings. The Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge night lighting system uses both daily and holiday lighting modes. Among them, the daily lighting mode is mainly white, showing the true color of the bridge, providing basic lighting for the bridge; the engineers use advanced dynamic variable frequency lamps to make the lighting energy-saving and environmentally friendly. The bridge section uses 1280 动态 dynamic variable frequency lamps, and the distance between the lamps is 35 meters, which can be based on the road illumination.

The demand achieves no level of dimming from 0% to 100%. The holiday lighting mode makes the main bridge become paralyzed by the colorful effect of the color-changing LED lights. In addition, in the underwater tunnel lighting system, the design concept of seeing the light is not used. The Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge lighting control relies on a powerful BIM system: the operator in the bridge management center can display the three-dimensional picture of the bridge by tapping the mouse and conveniently control the bridge lights. </p>
<li>Power supply</li>
<p>The power supply system of Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge is equipped with advanced unattended "MMJ" cable head welding technology, which not only solves the problem of limited space of cable trench, but also has the characteristics of low resistance and high strength.

It is subject to the advantages of fault current surge and long-term high-current operation, and reduces the operational risk. The bridge also adopts the network self-injection method to solve the problem that the 110 kV of the public station and the dedicated station cannot meet the line N-1, and the power supply is reliable. Sex. In addition, the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge is also equipped with 550 charging piles to serve the artificial island. </p>
<p>After the wind, temperature, vehicle and other loads, the bridge will have a certain displacement, and the expansion joints need to be set at a certain distance. The various cables on the bridge will withstand large tensions when passing through the expansion joints of the bridge, which will easily cause metal sheath fracture and insulation damage, which will bring malfunction to the communication and lighting of the bridge. The bridge deck near the cable-stayed cable of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge is equipped with a cable expansion device with a length of 1.7 meters and a folding material of the same width as the bridge. A total of 74 sets cover the four types of expansion and contraction requirements of the bridge and seven installation forms. The cable expansion device not only meets the requirements of the bridge itself, but also meets the requirements of cable bending radius and equipment seismic resistance. </p>
<li>Monitoring</li>
<p>The Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge has a monitoring platform for monitoring the entire line of traffic engineering equipment and lines. There are more than 100,000 monitoring points, which can not only detect the operation of the bridge's electromechanical equipment in real time, but also automatically remind the system if there is a circuit failure. Staff for precise troubleshooting solutions. In the submarine tunnel, in the event of a traffic accident, the on-site personnel can send help to the operation command center through the help alarm system on the cave wall. At the same time, the command center can find the accident scene through the real-time monitoring equipment in the tunnel, and can be in a few minutes. Transfer emergency or fire vehicles to rescue. </p>
<li>Anti-collision</li>
<p>The guardrail of Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge adopts metal beam-column guardrail with four-beam structure. The height of the guardrail is 1.5 meters, the inclined H-shaped column, the distance between the columns is 2 meters, the protection capacity reaches 520kJ, and all the indicators meet the requirements of BSEN1317 evaluation standard. After hitting the guardrail at a speed of 15 degrees and 80 kilometers per hour, it will not break through the guardrail and fall into the sea. In order to bring safe driving light to the owner and allow the driver to adapt to the tunnel before entering the tunnel, the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge has a 110-meter-wide dimming cover in the open section above the east-west artificial island tunnel entrance and exit; There are two sidewalks close to the wall on both sides to reduce the collision probability of the car; the tunnel wall is decorated with good optical performance and diffuse reflection fireproof material to make the driving visual effect comfortable. </p>
<li>Fire</li>
<p>The Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge submarine tunnel is equipped with advanced fire protection systems, including active and passive modes, including fire alarm systems, fire equipment linkage control systems, fire suppression systems, tunnel ventilation and exhaust systems, rescue and evacuation systems, Water supply network facilities and other supporting systems. According to the scale of the fire and the actual situation of the site, each system is started according to the scheduled emergency plan for fire fighting and on-site rescue. There is a safety gate every 135 meters in the tunnel to connect the emergency escape route. The middle service pipe gallery installs three sets of electric smoke exhaust valves every 67.5 meters. The monitoring induction system can open the nearest electric smoke exhaust valve by computer command. The fireworks are extracted through a large axial fan on the artificial island; the personnel in the tunnel can open the normally closed safety door into the safe passage and enter the safe area of ​​the artificial island. In order to prevent tunnel fires, the bridge prohibits dangerous goods vehicles from entering the tunnel. </p>
<li>Seismic</li>
<p>The Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge uses a seismic isolation bearing with a length and width of 1.77 meters and a combination of multiple layers of new high-damping rubber and steel plates. The isolated bearing is independently developed by China and has a bearing capacity of about 3,000 tons. If an earthquake occurs, the isolation support vertically provides a stable and reliable bearing capacity through the stiffened steel plate to effectively support the building; the horizontal direction utilizes the characteristics of large rubber viscosity, absorption of vibration energy, strong deformation ability, etc., and produces certain deformation under the action of external force. Absorbing seismic energy; after the earthquake occurs, the support returns to the initial position through the rubber's restoring force, avoiding the transfer of all energy to the building, transforming and consuming the vibration energy in the reciprocating motion of the seismic wave, and reducing the earthquake destructive power of the building. . The immersed tunnel has high seismic performance, and the damper cable is placed in the pipe to enhance the flexibility of the immersed pipe; if an earthquake occurs, the displacement and stagnation of the immersed pipe will not damage the pipe joint. </p>
<li>Drainage</li>
<p>The artificial island wave wall of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge is designed according to the standard of the 300-year wave. The standard height of the island is 4.5 to 5.0 meters higher than the average water level. The entire wave wall is about 8 meters higher than the daily water level. Set up the island drainage flow and the over-wave pump room to pump the seawater across the wave wall to the sea in time. In order to control the entry of rainwater into the tunnel, several horizontal intercepting ditches are set up at the slopes of the east and west islands and at the mouth of the buried section, collecting the road surface water in the open section of the tunnel, and lifting the discharge through the rain pump house of the tunnel; The vertical drainage side ditch is arranged on the low side of the tunnel pavement to evacuate the fire water and flushing wastewater during the operation period, and the waste water pump room set at the lowest point of the W-type longitudinal slope of the tunnel is used to enhance the outer row. </p>
<li>Alert</li>
<p>The Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge is equipped with an AIS-based ship anti-collision warning system. The early warning performance is superior to the traditional VTS system. The bridge piers are all equipped with AIS simulated beacons, and each navigation hole pier is equipped with an ultrasonic tide gauge, using VHF. The channel instantly transmits information to surrounding ships, radar stations or other base stations. </p>
<li>Communication</li>
<p>The whole bridge and tunnel sections of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge will be fully covered by 4G signals. Four 288-core optical cables from China's three major telecommunications operators will enter the Xi artificial island, the underwater tunnel and the eastern artificial island from the Zhuhai Highway Port along the bridge pipeline; Among them, 25 distributed base stations were installed in 25 gantry on the bridge, and 36 distributed base stations were installed in the subsea tunnel. </p>
<li>Charge</li>
<p>Because of the different toll collection modes in Mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau, the bridge toll collection system uses an open charging system, an electronic non-stop charging (ETC) and a manual semi-automatic charging (MEC). Taking into account the special charging application environment in China, the three sides of the Taiwan Strait and the use of existing ETC users, the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge Traffic Engineering Project Department has developed software compatible with China's mainland, Hong Kong and Macau ETC charges; after a total of 1110 times After the simulation test, the average recognition rate of the license plate system increased from less than 30% to 96.7%, and the average recognition time was shortened from 0.5 seconds to 0.3 seconds. </p>
