The annual paid vacation system being consulted has nothing to do with whether the Golden Week is cancelled or not. Next year's Golden Week vacation schedule will be announced at the end of this month and the beginning of next month. Whether the three Golden Weeks concerned by the outside world will be adjusted next year will have a clear answer. This is what the morning paper reporter got from the National Tourism Administration holiday yesterday.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  Meanwhile, according to Huang Tao, deputy secretary-general of the Chinese Folklore Association, the cancellation of the May Day Golden Week next year is likely to become a reality.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Holiday office: paid vacation has nothing to do with Golden Week adjustment　　<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Annual paid vacation and golden week are two concepts." Staff of the National Tourism Administration Holiday Office said that soliciting opinions on the paid annual leave system could not be regarded as a prelude to the abolition of the Golden Week. In his opinion, paid annual leave has nothing to do with whether the Golden Week is cancelled or not.　<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Previous public opinion has held that paid annual leave is essentially time-sharing vacation, which is the most effective way to solve the problems exposed by the Golden Week. Its implementation means that the Golden Week, which has been implemented for many years, will be cancelled.　<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, the staff of the National Tourism Administration Holiday Office explained to the morning paper yesterday that the purpose of paid annual leave is to guarantee workers'right to rest, while the Golden Week is a combination of national statutory holidays and double holidays. "The two concepts are totally different and can not be confused."　　<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He said that from the time sequence of the introduction, the two are also different. Article 45 of the Labour Law, which has been in effect since January 1, 1995, stipulates that the State shall adopt the system of annual vacation with pay. Workers who have worked continuously for more than one year shall be entitled to paid annual leave. Specific measures shall be formulated by the State Council."　<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The golden week vacation system began in 1999, when the State Council decided to combine the rest time of Spring Festival, May Day and Eleventh Day with the double holidays before and after, thus forming a seven-day long vacation. In June 2000, the golden week holiday system was formally established.　　<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The Golden Week Holiday Scheme will be announced next year　<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For next year's Golden Week holiday arrangements, the National Tourism Administration Holiday Office staff said: "At present, there is no notification from the State Council." He said that whether next year's Golden Week will be adjusted and whether all three Golden Weeks will be retained has not yet been clearly decided by the State Council. He also disclosed that the relevant state departments will formally announce next year's Golden Week holiday plan at the end of this month and early next month, when the relevant issues of concern to the outside world will be answered.　<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relevant Experts: Next Golden Week will be finalized　　<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to the information I have, next year's Golden Week holiday will be adjusted, and the May Day Golden Week will be cancelled." Huang Tao, deputy secretary-general of the Chinese Folklore Society and associate professor of the College of Literature, Renmin University of China, told the Morning Post yesterday that the three traditional festivals, Qingming Festival, Dragon Boat Festival and Mid-Autumn Festival, would take one day off each.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For New Year's Eve, Huang Tao said that next year's Spring Festival Golden Week is likely to start on New Year's Eve. "This has changed the usual practice that the golden week of the Spring Festival begins with the beginning of the New Year, that is to say, the traditional festival will also have a day off on New Year's Eve."　<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Huang Tao, deputy secretary-general of the Chinese Folklore Society, said that the Chinese Folklore Society has been participating in the discussion of national statutory holidays and traditional holidays by relevant state departments. Once the paid annual vacation system is implemented, it will be of great help to the protection of traditional festivals and people's attention to traditional festivals.<br></p>
