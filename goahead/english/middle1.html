	<div class="article"><p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the main artery of national economy, railway has been playing an important role in social development as an important means of transportation since its birth. Over the past decades, relying on independent innovation, China's railways have continuously upgraded and replaced, from the unforgettable green car to the comfortable "Renaissance", and the Phoenix Nirvana of China's railways has made a qualitative leap. Chinese people no longer travel in a single way, but more pursuit of speed and comfort, and more people's lives have become more tasty because of high-speed rail.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowadays, the distance between cities in China has been narrowed, "two cities, one family", "half-hour economic circle" and "three-hour economic circle" have become possible under the promotion of high-speed rail. In the past, distance made home far away, but now high-speed rail makes people hug the warmth of home tighter. Bus-intensive high-speed rail, high-speed rail, railway parts continue to adjust transport schemes, so that people travel more convenient, but also to make the rapid development of society more humane. For people living in the high-speed rail economic circle, high-speed rail not only makes extreme travel a part of their daily life, but also makes the communication between cities closer. It is conducive to improving the speed of personnel flow, resource integration and information exchange in the region, injecting a strong impetus into the regional economy and forming a more competitive city. Group.
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the introduction of high-speed train technology with a speed of 200 kilometers per hour to the independent development of "Harmony" and "Renaissance". From the operation of Beijing-Tianjin Intercity Railway and Beijing-Shanghai High-speed Railway, to the construction of high-speed railway in cooperation with Thailand, Indonesia and other countries, China's high-speed railway not only provides travel convenience for Chinese people, but also shines brilliantly on the world stage and shows to the world. This beautiful "China Business Card" of China High Speed Railway shows the charm of "Made in China" in the new era. <br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forty years of wind and rain, forty years of struggle history. In the new era, standing at a new starting point, I hope that China's high-speed railway will take scientific and technological innovation as its foundation, constantly enhance its comprehensive strength, contribute to China's wisdom and run at full speed towards the next brilliant. </p></div>
