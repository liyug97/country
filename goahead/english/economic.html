			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. oil and gas development
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The data display, in 2018 ago the third quarter, the crude oil output 141,220,000 tons, the same ratio drops 1.7%; The crude oil process load 440,340,000 tons, the same ratio grows 5.7%; The refined oil output 275,070,000 tons, the same ratio grows 7.6%; The refined oil apparent consumption quantity 241,850,000 tons, the same ratio grows 5.4%, in which gasoline, the diesel oil grows separately 6.4%, 3.7%. </p>

			<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. new energy vehicle development
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the policy of favorable, in January-September 2018, China's new energy vehicle sales reached 721,000 units, production and sales gradually achieved balance, which indicates that China's new energy vehicle market demand is rising rapidly. From the major auto companies in terms of new energy vehicle sales, BYD occupies the largest market share, in 2017, BYD new energy passenger car sales reached 114,000 units, accounting for 19.17%, the market sales ranked first in the country.</p>

		  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, auto regulators require automakers to significantly increase the sales of all-electric and semi-electric vehicles each year in the next few years. One of them stipulates the production ratio of new energy vehicles to traditional internal combustion engines. If it fails to meet the standards, it needs to purchase "carbon credits." "Rushing. Another rule is for the fuel efficiency of a car. These regulatory policies are an ambitious goal to serve China: to dominate the global electric vehicle market in 2030.
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to regulation, by 2020, the Chinese government will provide more than $50 billion in subsidies to the electric vehicle industry. China's two major power battery manufacturers – BYD and Ningde era – are actively recruiting from South Korea and the United States to enhance their R&D capabilities. At present, China has built nearly 200,000 electric vehicle charging piles.
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, all the public transportation vehicles in Shenzhen have been fully electrified, and the next step is to replace the taxis. Other cities that have implemented "limit orders" have also given green lights to electric cars. In the past few years, the global profit growth of multinational automakers has mainly originated in China, and they are naturally reluctant to give up this lucrative market. Volkswagen is committed to investing more than $10 billion in electric vehicle development projects in China. The real market demand for electric vehicles will increase greatly in 2019. If all goes well, China will hope to dominate the global electric vehicle market for a long time.
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Internet of Things development
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to relevant statistics, in the six years from 2012 to 2017, the number of new IoT devices connected worldwide exceeded 9 billion, and it is expected to increase by 2.6 billion and 3.1 billion respectively in 2018 and 2019. According to statistics from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, as of August this year, the number of IoT users of three basic telecom operators has reached 547 million, which has doubled since the end of 2017.</p>

In 2015, China's Internet of Things market was about 750 billion yuan, and in 2017 it was about 1.25 billion yuan. The market size of China's Internet of Things industry in recent years is shown in the following figure:</p>

			<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the analysis of Sino-US trade situation
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the statistics of the US Department of Commerce, in the whole year of 2017, the import and export volume of bilateral goods between the United States and China was 635.97 billion US dollars, an increase of 10.0%. Among them, the United States exported 130.37 billion US dollars to China, an increase of 12.8%, accounting for 8.4% of the total US exports, an increase of 0.5 percentage points; the United States imported 505.60 billion US dollars from China, an increase of 9.3%, accounting for 21.6% of the total US imports, an increase of 0.4 percentage point. The US trade deficit was 375.23 billion US dollars, an increase of 8.1%.
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main US exports to China are transportation equipment, mechanical and electrical products, plant products and chemical products. In 2017, exports were US$29.51 billion, US$25 billion, US$14.93 billion and US$11.19 billion, accounting for 22.6% and 19.2 of their total exports to China. %, 11.5%, and 8.6%, with changes of 14.8%, 5.3%, -10.7%, and 15.9%, respectively. Of the transportation equipment, the aerospace export was 16.27 billion US dollars, up 11.6%; the export of vehicles and its accessories was 13.18 billion US dollars, up 19.4%.</p>

		  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United States imports mainly from China's mechanical and electrical products. In 2017, it imported US$256.63 billion, accounting for 50.8% of the total US imports from China, an increase of 13.4%. Among them, the import of electrical machinery and electrical products was US$147 billion, an increase of 14.0%; the import of machinery and equipment was US$109.63 billion, an increase of 12.5%. Furniture toys, textiles and raw materials, and base metals and products rank second, third and fourth respectively in the United States from China. Imports in 2017 were US$60.58 billion, US$38.99 billion and US$25.38 billion, accounting for US imports from China. The total increase of 12.0%, 7.7% and 5.0%, respectively, was 7.9%, -1.2% and 9.2%. China's furniture, shoes and umbrellas and other light industrial products and leather goods bags accounted for 60.4%, 58.3% and 53.3% of the US import market, with absolute competitive advantage. The competitors of Chinese products mainly come from Mexico, Vietnam and Italy. China is also the first source of imports for US mechanical and electrical products, textiles and raw materials, base metals and products and plastics and rubber.
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the statistics of the US Department of Commerce, in 2017, the import and export volume of US goods was US$3,889.64 billion, an increase of 6.9% over the previous year (the same below). Among them, exports were 1,546.73 billion US dollars, an increase of 6.6%; imports were 2,342.91 billion US dollars, an increase of 7.1%. The trade deficit was 796.17 billion US dollars, an increase of 8.1%.
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of countries (regions), US exports to Canada, Mexico, China, and Japan in 2017 were US$282.47 billion, US$242.99 billion, US$130.37 billion, and US$67.70 billion, respectively, accounting for 18.3% and 15.7% of US exports. 8.4% and 4.4%, up 5.9%, 5.8%, 12.8% and 7.1%; imports from China, Mexico, Canada and Japan were US$505.60 billion, US$314.05 billion, US$299.98 billion and US$136.54 billion, respectively. US imports totaled 21.6%, 13.4%, 12.8%, and 5.8%, up 9.3%, 6.8%, 8.0%, and 3.4%. The top four trade deficits of the United States are China, Mexico, Japan and Germany. In 2017, the deficit was 375.23 billion US dollars, 71.06 billion US dollars, 68.85 billion US dollars and 64.25 billion US dollars, with a change range of 8.1%, 10.4% and 0.1 respectively. % and -0.8%. The US trade surplus mainly comes from Hong Kong and the Netherlands in China. In 2017, the surplus was 32.47 billion US dollars and 24.49 billion US dollars, an increase of 18.1% and 3.9%.
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;China's exports and imports fell for the second consecutive year in 2015 and 2016. In 2017, due to the recovery of the world economy, exports increased, while strong domestic demand such as infrastructure investment pushed up imports. The trade balance surplus fell to 422.5 billion US dollars, a decrease of 17% over the previous year.
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the export side, PCs, mobile phones and toys have performed strongly. In terms of imports, semiconductor imports have increased, while imports of crude oil, natural gas and iron ore have also increased significantly.
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the perspective of trade with the United States, the value of exports increased by 12% over the previous year, reaching $429.7 billion, and imports increased by 15% to $153.9 billion. Imports of soybeans, aircraft, crude oil and natural gas increased, but at the same time, in the context of the strong US economy, exports of Chinese electronic products also ushered in growth, and the trade surplus with the United States expanded. US President Trump regards the huge deficit with China as a problem and is stepping up pressure on China through anti-dumping duties and other measures.
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December 1, 2018, Chinese President Xi Jinping reached a "close truce" agreement with US President Trump. Trump said that the United States will not impose more tariffs on the US$200 billion Chinese exports to the United States on January 1 next year. The negotiations will be stepped up in the direction of canceling all tariff increases, and China will expand the purchase of US products to ease the trade imbalance between the two sides. Although the White House’s statement said that whether the US imposes additional tariffs depends on the negotiations between the two parties within 90 days, most of the international media have shown a feeling of “shadowing the flowers”. Through this important meeting, the two heads of state made plans for properly solving the problems between China and the United States and promoting the development of Sino-US relations, pointing out the direction.
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, China's economic outlook in 2019
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Sino-US trade friction will lead to economic downturn
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Domestic tightening policies such as de-leverage in 2018 are the main cause of the slowdown in economic growth, and the biggest downward pressure in 2019 may come from the uncertainty related to the US tariff increase and trade war. It is predicted that from January 2019, the United States will increase the tariff rate of 200 billion US dollars of products from 10% to 25% (previously, 25 billion tariffs have been imposed on 50 billion Chinese products). In addition, the United States may also extend the scope of tariff increases to all Chinese imports.
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Estimating the US to impose a 25% tariff on China's 250 billion products may drag down GDP growth by more than 0.8 percentage points in 2019. Among them, the first round of direct impact brought by the weakening of exports may drag GDP growth rate by 0.5 percentage points. The trade war will also lead to a slowdown in global demand, which will drag down corporate profits and employee wages, and then affect corporate investment and household consumption, respectively. It is estimated that the second round of indirect effects will drag GDP growth rate by 0.3 percentage points. In terms of employment, the slowdown in export growth may directly lead to the loss of 5,200,000 jobs in 2019. However, as the spillover effect of trade wars on investment and consumption expands, the employment affected may be much larger than the above estimate. In addition, China may also have a negative impact on tariffs on imported goods from the United States, but a comprehensive reduction in import tariffs should be able to substantially offset its drag.
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most serious negative impact of Sino-US trade friction escalation and tariff increases may be the impact of corporate investment and employment through uncertainty and gradual shifts in global supply chains. Some of the production activities related to US exports in the global supply chain may leave China, and some of the new production capacity for the Chinese market may be transferred to China. These long-term effects are difficult to quantify accurately, but it is expected that the potential growth rate of GDP in the next few years will face downward pressure.
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Policy relaxation to resist downward pressure on the economy
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is expected that China will continue to loosen its policy of relaxation, which will partially offset the negative impact of the trade war. Therefore, GDP growth slowed to 6% in 2019 and stabilized at 6% in 2020. With the impact of the trade war in the coming months, the easing policy may be further overweight. The most important policy may be to boost infrastructure investment, and to reduce corporate and individual tax burdens to support growth. It is estimated that net exports will negatively drag GDP growth rate by 0.5% in 2019, and the growth rate will be slightly reduced in 2020; infrastructure investment growth will rebound to more than 10%, while real estate and manufacturing investment will weaken; real consumption growth will slow down. 0.5 percentage points to 6.7%. The weakening of consumption is mainly due to the slowdown in income growth, the decline in real estate sales, and the emergence of unemployment in some export-related industries. The policy of individual tax reform and other promotion fees can partially offset its downward pressure.
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The impact of policy easing has been limited so far. Since the end of July, the government has introduced a number of measures to relax and promote growth. The central bank has repeatedly lowered the RRR and increased the liquidity; the speed of local government bond issuance, the review of the PPP project has been successfully reviewed, and so on, to support the infrastructure investment; the implementation of the new rules for the implementation of the new regulations, slightly more than the previous draft There has been relaxation. In recent months, the shadow credit has narrowed, and the overall credit conditions have improved. Further tax cuts and fee reduction measures have been introduced. So far, these measures have not had a significant impact on economic activity, because policy relaxation is still moderate, and the government is still wary of the side effects that new stimulus policies may have on the stability of the financial system. In addition, the control over the implicit debt of local governments is still tight, and related policy restrictions such as environmental protection and shadow credit still exist, so the policy relaxation time seems to be longer than usual for the transmission of credit and economic activities.
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Infrastructure investment will increase in 2019
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2019, infrastructure investment is expected to once again become the main force driving economic growth, and the growth rate has rebounded from 2% this year to more than 10%. It is expected that the budget deficit will rise slightly to 3% of GDP next year, and the scale of local special bond issuance will increase (by another 500-700 billion yuan to 1.8-2 trillion yuan), and local government financing platform financing will increase. Helps support infrastructure investment. In addition, the strict relaxation of strict control of local government implicit debt, the release of more powerful and clearer signals at the decision-making level can prompt local governments and banks to accelerate their actions. Policy relaxation may begin to increase from December 2018, but most policy effects are expected to begin in the second quarter of 2019.
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new tax cuts in 2019 may reach more than 1% of GDP, but the multiplier effect may be limited. In 2018, corporate tax reductions and personal income tax cuts totaled 1.3 trillion yuan, some of which took effect in 2019 (such as the deduction of tax reform), or further extended tax cuts in 2019. In addition, it is reported that the Ministry of Finance is considering further reduction of value-added tax and corporate income tax, and the social security rate paid by enterprises may be further reduced. The overall new tax cuts in 2019 may exceed 1% of GDP. Reducing personal income tax will benefit low- and middle-income families and help boost low-end consumption. Lowering VAT and corporate income tax can support corporate profits, but in the case of weak economic prospects, companies are unlikely to increase capital expenditures, so their multiplier effect is relatively limited. If there are new tax reduction measures, they may be announced as early as mid-December, and a specific plan will be issued after the two meetings in March next year.The new tax cuts in 2019 may reach more than 1% of GDP, but the multiplier effect may be limited.

If there are new tax reduction measures, they may be announced as early as mid-December, and a specific plan will be issued after the two meetings in March next year.
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. The monetary policy is relaxed and the credit market rebounds.
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is expected that with the further relaxation of monetary policy, the overall credit growth rate is expected to rebound moderately. Although the central bank has repeatedly stressed that monetary policy should be “stable”, it is expected that the central bank will also reduce the number of times in 2019 to ensure sufficient liquidity in the market. Therefore, although the central bank should not cut the benchmark deposit and loan interest rate, the market interest rate may fall slightly. It is expected that the 7-day repurchase rate (DR007) will fall to 2.4% at the end of 2019, and the 10-year bond yield will fall to 3.3%. It is expected that the overall credit growth rate (social financing scale balance minus stock financing ABS loan write-off + local government bond balance) will rebound from 10.5% in 2018 to around 11%. Bank lending may remain strong, and recent policy easing may drive credit improvements to the private economy and small and micro enterprises. Shadow credit has shrunk dramatically in 2018 and may stabilize or expand slightly in 2019. The total issuance of new local government bonds may rise to 2.8-3 trillion yuan.
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inflationary pressures should be limited. Although China has successively raised tariffs on US imports such as soybeans, and the depreciation of the renminbi may push up import costs and bring about imported inflation, the slowdown in economic growth and the pressure on the labor market will offset the impact of the former. Oil prices, food (especially pork) prices may be high, but overall CPI is expected to slow to 2% and 1.8% in 2019 and 2020. On the other hand, with the decline in domestic demand and the easing of supply and demand, the PPI may fall to around 1.8% next year.
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The potential benefits of supply-side reforms may also be lower than in the past.
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to policy stimulus, China will further promote reform and opening up. Given the various constraints, the government may increasingly rely on reform and opening up to achieve its growth goals. For example, in the context of the trade war, the government has increased tax cuts and fees, further opened up domestic industries and financial markets, strengthened cooperation with other trading partners, and increased export tax rebates. At a time when market sentiment is sluggish, the decision-making level expressed firm and clear support for private enterprises, and promised to continue to deepen market-oriented reforms, including the reform of state-owned mixed ownership, and plans to further reduce tax cuts for enterprises. If these policies are successfully introduced, it should help release China's growth potential in the context of external shocks.
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. The pressure on RMB depreciation has increased
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2019, the renminbi will face greater depreciation pressure. First, with the uncertainty related to tariffs and trade wars affecting exports, it is expected that the foreign trade surplus of goods will fall to 2.8% of GDP in 2019, the annual current account surplus may disappear, and even the first deficit in 24 years may occur. Second, domestic and foreign spreads will continue to narrow. Coupled with the uncertainties associated with the trade war, the expectation of RMB depreciation may increase and lead to an increase in the size of capital outflows. In addition, the stronger the easing policy China has introduced for the impact of the hedging trade war, the larger the current account deficit may be, and the faster the external balance will deteriorate.
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the traditional policy stimulus faces some constraints, we still believe that the central bank will not actively guide the devaluation of the renminbi to hedge the impact of tariffs and boost economic growth. Depreciation can indeed help alleviate the adverse effects of tariff increases, but it cannot completely offset the impact of trade wars on the macro economy, especially on some sectors. Increased uncertainty in the trade war will also lead to companies cutting or diverting investment. In addition, the sharp depreciation of the renminbi will weaken market confidence and lead to capital panic outflows, threatening the stability of the domestic financial system. Finally, we believe that China is still sensitive to political pressure from the United States and may wish to avoid potential conflicts in the financial sector.
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of a comprehensive trade war (that is, the United States imposes a tariff of 25% or more on all Chinese imports), or if the US dollar is further stronger than the current level, it is expected that the RMB exchange rate will depreciate by the end of 2019 and may reach 7.5 or so. On the other hand, if the Sino-US trade war is moderated and/or the US dollar is significantly weaker against other major currencies, the exchange rate of the RMB against the US dollar may remain around 7 in 2019.
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. the real estate market fell
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Real estate sales are expected to fall by 4-6% in 2019 and 0-2% in 2020. The monetary resettlement of shantytowns has significantly boosted the growth of real estate sales in 2016-2017, but it is expected that its contribution to sales growth will decline significantly in the future, which is one of the most important reasons for the weakening of real estate sales in 2019. If the total target for shantytown renovation in 2019 is reduced to 5 million households (5.8 million in 2018) and the proportion of monetized resettlement is reduced by 10 percentage points, it is estimated that this will drag the sales of commercial residential buildings by about 5 percentage points. In addition, the decline in export growth, the uncertainty related to trade wars and the expectation of RMB depreciation may all drag down the sentiment in the real estate market. However, any liquidity and relaxation of credit policies may indirectly boost the real estate market.
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the current inventory level is low, and new construction and investment in real estate next year may be relatively stable. After strong growth in recent months, new construction started to increase by 16% year-on-year. Year-to-date real estate investment increased by 10% year-on-year, which was basically driven by the strong growth of land acquisition fees, while non-land purchases of real estate investment activities fell year-on-year. In view of the tightening of credit for developers this year, developers may speed up the start of construction to obtain loans, so new construction data may be pushed up. Considering that stocks are low and real estate sales are often ahead of other indicators, it is expected that new construction will fall by 0-2% in 2019, while real estate investment growth will slow down to 2-4%. In 2020, the decline in new construction may expand and investment may further weaken.
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the overall GDP growth slows, the consumption growth rate in 2019 may decline slightly, and it is expected to stabilize in 2020. A weaker export will drag down employment and household income, but infrastructure-related support policies and successive tax reforms can offset the impact of the former to some extent. With market sentiment and household income weakening, consumer confidence is likely to decline. At present, consumer credit regulation is tight and household leverage has risen sharply, which may amplify the impact of weak consumer confidence.
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even so, consumption growth will remain relatively stable, and the trend of consumption upgrading should continue, but the pace may slow down. In the next few years, the continuous improvement of residents' income (5-7%), the improvement of credit availability, the promotion of employment and the improvement of social security will continue to deepen, and should support the actual consumption to maintain a growth rate of 6-7%. Downside risks will mainly come from a global trade war and/or a significant downturn in the real estate market. Even so, as more low-tier urban consumers have the ability to buy better products, the software and hardware facilities in the areas of pension, tourism and leisure are perfect, and residents increase spending in the leisure and service sectors, we expect consumption upgrades to remain a long-term trend.
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. The economic center of gravity moves further southward
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As China's economic focus shifts further southward, Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau's Dawan District, as the forerunner of regional coordinated development, may play a pivotal role in China's next round of growth. Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau are comprised of Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Hong Kong and surrounding cities with a total population of over 70 million and a per capita GDP of over US$20,000. A number of China's most innovative start-ups and large-scale corporate headquarters are located here, with the world's leading hardware and software capabilities and deep international financial resources. Like other parts of China, Dawan District also needs a large number of high-tech blue-collar and white-collar workers. This demand is driving the rising wages in the local area and the transformation of manufacturing to high added value and automation. In the decade from 2000 to 2010, the region's population growth rate exceeded that of other provinces in China, with an average age of 5 years lower than that of the Northeast, and a population dependency ratio close to 10%. Although the demographic dividends in other parts of China have gradually disappeared, the population dividend in Dawan District is still sufficient due to the influx of large numbers of migrants. Local governments at all levels have also tried to retain these outsiders by allowing foreign children to enroll in local schools and to include local social security. In 2019, we will see whether governments in the Greater Bay Area can extend local successes to the entire region. If it can be achieved, Dawan District will have a huge attraction for talents, investors and enterprises, thus creating a virtuous circle of industrial development in the 21st century.</p>
