The four books and five detailed records of the political, military, diplomatic, cultural and other historical materials in the history of China's early ideological and cultural development, as well as the important thoughts of Confucius and Mencius. The four books refer to the four works of "University", "The Mean", "The Analects of Confucius" and "Mencius". The Five Classics refer to five works: The Book of Songs, The Book of Songs, The Book of Rites, The Book of Changes, and Spring and Autumn. "Spring and Autumn" is too simple because of the text, usually with the interpretation of "Spring and Autumn" "Zuo Zhuan" "Ram Biography" "Gu Liang Chuan" published separately. In addition, "Zhou Li" is actually a book between the two Han Dynasty.</p></div>
