In the future, with the further improvement of China's national strength, China will also play an increasingly important role on the world stage.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chen Zhenquan, in an interview with the 11th China Journalists'Delegation, said that China's development achievements in recent years have lifted 600 million people out of poverty and poverty, which can not be overstated in terms of "horrifying the world and weeping for ghosts and gods". He praised the Chinese leaders for their wisdom, modesty and eagerness to learn from other countries'experience, which helped China come to the top and achieve transcendental development.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that since Premier Lee Kuan Yew first visited China in 1976, Sino-Singapore exchanges have lasted for more than 40 years. Seventy-five percent of Singapore's population is Chinese. New China and Singapore have a very long history and culture. There is a natural sense of cordiality in their exchanges. Singapore has a small number of small land, and the implementation of economic pilot projects has achieved relatively rapid results. Singapore's development experience and the detours it has gone through can provide reference for China.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that over the years, New Zealand and China have learned from each other and benefited from each other. Taking the three intergovernmental cooperation projects between Singapore and China as an example, from Suzhou Industrial Park, Tianjin Eco-city to Chongqing Strategic Interconnection Demonstration Project, the scope of cooperation between the two sides is wider and the areas discussed are more in-depth. China's post-development advantages make China's development in some areas even better than Singapore's.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of Xiamen, the host city of the Ninth BRICS Leaders'Meeting, he said that many Singaporean Chinese came from Fujian Province. When they were young, they came to Singapore from China. After their successful career, they also liked to return to their hometown to invest and contribute to local development. He said that when he traveled to Xiamen, he found that the streets and alleys in Xiamen were very clean, which showed that people were very aware of environmental protection.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that as a witness of the times, we need to recognize the situation, seize the opportunities and do our best for the development of Sino-Singapore cooperation.<br></p>
