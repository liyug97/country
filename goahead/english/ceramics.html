			<div class="word"><p align="left"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ceramic is the general term for pottery and porcelain. It can be said that an important part of the history of the Chinese nation is the history of ceramic development, the achievements of the Chinese people in science and technology, and the pursuit and shaping of the United States. In many ways, it is reflected through ceramic production and forms a very typical technical and artistic feature of various eras. It is universally acknowledged that porcelain was invented by the Chinese. The invention of porcelain is based on the continuous development and improvement of pottery technology. The White pottery of the Shang Dynasty was made of porcelain clay(Kaolin) as a raw material, and the firing temperature was above 1000 Â°C. It was the basis for the appearance of original porcelain.</p></div>
