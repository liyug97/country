<h1>Revival number</h1>
<div class="box_details">
  <p> <img src="images/bottom2-34.jpg" alt="" title="" class="right" width="250" height="200"/> Fuxing EMU train is a Chinese standard EMU The Chinese name, the EMU train developed by the China Railway Corporation and with complete independent intellectual property rights and reaching the world advanced level, is currently the highest speed railway train in the world. </p>
  <p>The English code is CR, and the train level is higher than the CRH series. The three levels are CR420/300/200, the figures represent the top speed, and the sustained speeds correspond to 350, 250 and 160 respectively, which are suitable for high-speed railway (high-speed rail), express railway (fast rail) and intercity railway (city rail). The early two models were the Red Dragon CR400AF and the Golden Phoenix CR400BF. The Renaissance CR400 series has an upper speed of 400 kilometers per hour and a standard speed of 350 kilometers per hour. </p>
  <p>At 350 km/h, the total energy consumption decreased by 10% compared to the Harmony CRH380. The revival number has increased from 300 kilometers to 350 kilometers per hour, and energy consumption has increased by 20%-30%. Because Beijing-Shanghai high-speed rail passenger traffic accounts for more than one-sixth of China's high-speed rail passenger traffic, and its economic capacity and demand are strong along the line, China Railway Corporation's high-speed railway in Beijing and Shanghai will gradually resume 350 speeds, and other routes will depend on conditions. </p>
  <p>In 2012, China Standard EMU "Revival" officially launched R&D; on June 25, 2017, China Standard EMU was officially named "Revival" and officially launched in Beijing and Shanghai on the 26th; 2018 From July 1st, the national railway will implement a new train operation map, and 16 long-formed "Revival" EMUs will be put into operation for the first time. On August 1, the same year, the EMU trains running on the Beijing-Tianjin inter-city railway have all been in operation. Change to "Revival". </p>
  <p>On December 9, 2018, the "Revival" China Standard EMU project won the fifth China Industrial Award. On December 24, 2018, a number of "Fuxing" new EMUs, which were 350 km/h and 17 long-formed groups, with a speed of 250 km/h, 8 vehicles, and a speed of 160 km/h, were first publicly unveiled</p>.
</div>
<h2 class="h2"><span>1</span>Development Background</h2>
<div class="content">
  <p>To comprehensively improve the design, software development and manufacturing technology level of China's high-speed railway EMUs, create a high-speed EMU design and manufacturing platform suitable for China's national conditions and road conditions, and realize the autonomy, standardization and serialization of China's high-speed railway EMUs. The EMU has been created by China to China. Since 2012, under the leadership of China Railway Corporation, China Railway Science Research Institute has taken the lead in bringing together the strength of CRRC Group and related companies to carry out the design and development of China Standard EMUs. </p>
</div>
<h2 class="h2"><span>2</span> New naming</h2>
<div class="content4">
  <h2>English code</h2>
  <p>On January 3, 2017, China Railway Corporation officially issued the “Model Qualification Certificate” and “Manufacturing License” for the China Standard EMU to Sifang and Changke. The Chinese standard EMU is also officially named. </p>
  <p>The "Red Dragon" produced by the Quartet was named CR400AF, and the "Golden Phoenix" produced by Changke was named CR400BF, which officially abandoned the named sequence of CRH. The original CRH sequence name will no longer be used for the Chinese standard EMU, but whether to continue to retain the Harmony name for subsequent new models, there is no clear official news. </p>

<div class="content7">
  <h2>Body color</h2>
  <p>The Chinese standard EMUs in the lab, "Red Dragon" and "Golden Phoenix", are red and gold, respectively. </p>
</div>
<div class="content8">
  <h2>Three levels</h2>
  <p>The new naming rules were confirmed by the Iron General Party Group meeting at the end of November 2016. In the future, the Chinese EMUs will be named CR200/300/400, corresponding to three sustained speed grades of 160, 250 and 350 (km/h). Represents the top speed, for example, 400 stands for a maximum speed of 400km/h and above, and a continuous running speed of 350km/h. </p>
  <p>The three speeds meet different market demands. China's high-speed railways are mainly 350-250 or 250-speed, and the China Express Railway is 200-160. Three speed trains can meet these four speed requirements, and the CR200 is compatible with both fast rail speeds. </p>
  <p>The "Revival" has two models, "CR400AF" and "CR400BF". China Railway Corporation stated that it will gradually develop CR300 and CR200 series of Chinese standard EMUs according to the needs of the transportation market. </p>
  <p>The head of the iron company said that in the future, based on the "Revival" China Standard EMU platform, it will continue to carry out scientific and technological innovations in terms of safety, economy, comfort, energy saving and humanization, and develop different speed grades to adapt to different environments. The autonomy of demand and the standardization of EMU series products to better meet market demand and provide more choices for people's travel. </p>

</div>
<h2 class="h2"><span>4</span>Use meaning</h2>
<div class="content11">
  <p>The successful development and operation of the “Revival” CR400 series EMUs is of great strategic significance for China to fully master the high-speed rail core technology and accelerate the “going out” of the high-speed rail. </p>
</div>
<h2 class="h2"><span>5</span> at the 250 level</h2>
<div class="content12">
  <p>The three levels are CR400/300/200. The numbers indicate the top speed and the sustained speeds correspond to 350, 250 and 160 respectively, which is suitable for high-speed railway, express railway and intercity railway. </p>
  <p>On October 25, 2017, the 250-kilometer "Revival" China Standard EMU (CR300) collection technical plan report meeting was held in Shanghai. Compared with the “Harmony” EMU with a speed of 250 km per hour, the “Revival” China Standard EMU with a speed of 250 km per hour will achieve the following breakthroughs: First, achieve full autonomy. Its software and hardware are all designed, manufactured or selected independently, and have completely independent intellectual property rights. The second is performance improvement. The EMU's running resistance, energy consumption, noise and other indicators are better, safety monitoring is more comprehensive, vehicle life is longer, and the train as a whole and key system has reached the world's advanced level. The third is more intelligent. Realize the intelligent state monitoring, maintenance and service of EMU. Fourth, the system adopts Chinese standards. In combination with the Chinese railway operating environment and operational needs, the train operation, operation and maintenance are unified. Different manufacturers' EMUs can be re-linked, which is beneficial to reduce the maintenance cost. In the next step, China Railway Corporation will organize a technical plan to determine the 250-kilometer “Fuxing” China Standard EMU and carry out prototype development work</p>
