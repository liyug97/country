<h2 class="h2"><span>2</span>Character Story</h2>
<div class="content4"><br>
  <p>In the early spring, a verification flight training over a certain sea area in the East China Sea. </p>
  <p>A fighter jet swooped down from a height of several kilometers, bypassing the rolling hills of the island and attacking the sea. Then, a blind man rolled over and pulled up, kicking the fuselage, looking for the target...</p>
  <p>The driver of the aircraft is the Air Force Super Pilot, and the head of a certain delegation of the South Air Force, Hao Jingwen. </p>
  <p>In November 2011, Hao Jingwen was appointed as the head of the team, which coincided with the first air force inspection of the air force against the air force. He took the high-end opponent's impressive record and won the Air Force air war crown "Golden Helmet". </p>
  <p>At this time, the sea under the wing is full of blue water. In the cabin, Hao Jingwen stared at the instrument in front of him, and the control aircraft continued to decline. As the altitude continues to drop, the rolling waves rush to the top of the head, as if to swallow the fighter. </p>
  <p>The fighter plane is flat! At that moment, the wave was almost close to the wing, and the burning sea of ​​the engine spurted a white wave mark on the surface of the sea. </p>
  <p>The passage of time, Hao Jingwen's palms sweated and soaked the gloves. </p>
  <p>"Discover the target!" "Stable interception!" After a long-distance ultra-low-altitude maneuver, Hao Jingwen captured the sea moving target firmly. </p>
  <p>"Emission!" Hao Jingwen suddenly pulled up the fighter and fired the missile quickly! </p>
  <p>This time, Hao Jingwen first verified the tactics of a certain type of fighter aircraft in the unfamiliar sea and air, and set a new record for the lowest altitude, longest time and farthest distance of the aircraft. </p>
  <p>"The ultra-low altitude flight at sea is extremely risky." Hao Jingwen, who walked down the plane, told reporters that due to the sea and sky, long-term flight is prone to illusions, and the airflow is unstable and the altitude is extremely low. The room for maneuver is very small. There are no mistakes. </p>
  <p>This thrilling exercise is a commonplace for Hao Jingwen. In a red and blue confrontation exercise, Hao Jingwen cooperated with the pilot Li Debing, and once "rounded down" the opponent's fighter. </p>
  <p>That time, the red fighter formation just flew to the air combat area, and the blue fighters patrolling the battles dive from the height of 10,000 meters, flew to the end of the formation of the red fighters, and suddenly turned and carried out a tail-bit attack. Keep up the chasm. </p>
  <p>Hao Jingwen added the engine thrust to the maximum state, and the lever jumped rapidly, and there was no trace. Just as the blue plane was searching on the cloud, Hao Jingwen drove unexpectedly from the direction of the sun, and the missile under the wing slammed into the blue plane...</p>
