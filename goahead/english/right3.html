		<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 500-meter spherical radio telescope, referred to as FAST, is also known as the "Chinese Eye of Heaven". China's Tian Eye was conceived by Chinese astronomer Nan Rendong in 1994. It took 22 years from pre-research to completion, and it was inaugurated on September 25, 2016. It is led by the National Observatory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. It has our own intellectual property rights and the largest single-aperture and most sensitive radio telescope in the world. FAST will remain the world leader in the next 20-30 years.</p>

		<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nan Rendong, chief engineer and chief scientist of Tian Eye Project, said that with this huge "Tian Eye", scientists can peek at the information of interstellar interaction, observe dark matter, determine the mass of black holes, and even search for possible extraterrestrial civilization. Many unique skills make it the world's leading radio telescope, which will also provide an important opportunity for new discoveries in world astronomy.</p>

		<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scientists said recently that China's astronomical telescope has discovered a habitable planet on which they have found liquid water and vegetation, believing it will be another Earth. Of course, there are many planets with liquid water. Why do scientists think this planet is a livable planet because of vegetation? Scientists found green vegetation on it. Given the presence of vegetation, the planet's environment is certainly suitable for living things. It's possible to be the second Earth.

		<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be our best choice if we could make interstellar migration. At the same time, scientists also said that the discovery of livable planets was a great achievement in China's astronomical telescopes and space exploration. Scientists believe that with the continuous exploration of the celestial eye, we will be able to discover aliens one day. But Stephen Hawking, a famous physicist, once said, "When you find an alien signal, don't take the consequences at your own risk!"
