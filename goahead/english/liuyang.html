<h2 class="h2"><span>2</span>Character review</h2>
<div class="content4"><br>
  <p>When I selected Liu Yang, I went to the interview. I was very impressed by the details. At the time, when we were interviewing their troops, there was a link to test their spoken English. We first interviewed another female pilot. She believes that the competition between comrades and friends is benign, and honesty is the first. (Yang Liwei Review)</p>
  <p>Although all three of us belong to a lesser-speaking personality, her eloquence is very good. She often speaks and her knowledge is very profound. Liu Yang is also very modest, and people often get along with each other from life, work, and learning. From such a few points, Liu Yang’s work is very good. (Jing Haipeng Review)</p>
  <p>Liu Yang’s impression on her is simple and bold, and Liu Yang’s words are very few. The clothes on the week are very simple. From the outside, it’s very inconspicuous. It’s very serious to do things. In her impression, Liu Yang’s high school has never been three years. Please take a vacation, never be late and leave early, and the discipline is very strong.
