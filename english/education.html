But at the same time, people have self-conscious thinking and have their own sensory dimensions. Therefore, any educational ideology may not be absolutely correct, but should understand the direction of thinking in a perceptual way, as long as he does not deviate from things. Intrinsic; education is a kind of teaching of thinking, and people have different thinking trends because of their own ideology. Therefore, education should be educated in the most objective and fair sense of consciousness, so, human thinking It is not too biased, and gradually matures and rationalized by the richness of thinking, and thus, towards the most rational self and having the most correct thinking and cognition, this is the root of education. </p>

<h2 class="h2"><span>2</span>History</h2>
<div class="content4"><br>
  <h2>Europe</h2>
  <p>In the West, the origins of education are greatly influenced by religious organizations: priests recognize the importance of education and establish a school system. In Europe, many of the original universities have a Catholic background. A new National Scottish Church was established after the Scottish Reformation. </p>
  <h2>China</h2>
  <p>Chinese education begins in Chinese classical writings, not religious organizations. In the early days, Chinese officials appointed education officials to manage the empire. The civil service examination system used to select officials was established in the Sui Dynasty. Tang Taizong of the Tang Dynasty perfected the imperial examination system. </p>
  <p>At the end of the 19th century, He Ziyuan and Qiu Fengjia and other sages first established a new school such as Yunandong Primary School, Tongren School, Xingmin Middle School, and Shima Primary School. They cultivated the 1911 Revolution and the national construction. A large number of valuable talents. Subsequently, China's modern education system has been continuously improved and strengthened. </p>
  <p>In the 1990s, China’s education system has undergone major changes, and private capital has re-entered the education field. </p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
  <p>The origin of Japanese education is closely related to religion. The school is a temple for young people who want to study Buddhism as a monk. Later, the children who want to learn are going to "Tera-koya" (meaning temple lodge) to learn how to read and write Japanese. </p>
<h2>India</h2>
  <p>Institutionalized education in India has a long history, and it is verified that India has a well-developed education system before the rise of Buddhism. The modernization of education can be divided into two major stages of development during the colonial period and after independence. The colonial period was the starting stage of India's educational modernization, including the transition period from traditional education to modern education (1498-19th century); the formation period of the colonial Indian education system, the westernization period of Indian education (early 19th century to 20th century) The first period, the rise and development of national education (in the early 20th century ~ 1947 independence) three periods. After independence in 1947, Indian education entered its all-round development stage. </p>
<h2>World Education Trends in the 21st Century</h2>
  <p>The percentage of illiterate people who have not received any school education has declined over the past few decades. From 36% in 1960 to 25% in 2000. </p>
  <p>In developing countries, the percentage of illiterate people in 2000 was only half of that in 1970. In developed countries, illiteracy has also fallen from 6% to 1%, and those who have not received school education have fallen from 5% to 2%. </p>
  <p>On December 3, 2018, the 44th plenary meeting of the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly was held at the United Nations Headquarters in New York. The meeting adopted a resolution to set January 24th as the International Education Day. </p>

  <h2>Chinese</h2>
  <p>I was first seen in "The Mencius and the Heart": "The gentleman has three music, and the king of the world does not coexist with the priests. The parents have nothing to do, the brothers have no reason, and they are also happy. They are not in the sky, they are unruly, and they are also happy." "The world is talented and educated, Sanle also." Xu Shen explained in "Said Wen Jie Zi", "Teaching, applying, and acting under the same effect"; "Yu, raising children to make good also." "Education" became a common word, and it was in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. At the end of the 19th century, the founders of the Chinese revolutionary education of the Revolution of 1911, He Ziyuan and Qiu Fengjia, first opened their ethos, and ruled out the interference of stubborn and conservative forces, and successfully established and promoted new schools. Subsequently, the Qing government under pressure from the situation, carried out a series of reforms on education. At the end of 1905, the new academic system was promulgated, the imperial examination system was abolished, and a new school was promoted nationwide. In 1909, after the local imperial examinations ceased, Western studies gradually became the main form of school education. </p>
  <p>The passage of the word "education" in modern Chinese is linked to the modernization of Chinese education, reflecting the shift in the modernity of Chinese educational discourse from "learning-based" to "teaching-based". </p>
  <h2>Western</h2>
  <p>In the West, the word education comes from the Latin educate. The prefix "e" has the meaning of "out", meaning "extracting" or "exporting", meaning that by some means, some kind of potential is actually in the body. And things inside the mind are triggered. From the etymology, the word "education" in the West is meant to be intrinsic. Emphasis on education is a kind of natural activity, which aims to bring out the inherent or potential qualities of natural persons from the inside out to become a realistic development state. </p>

<h2 class="h2"><span>4</span> Ancient Behavior</h2>
<div class="content4"><br>
  <p>The emergence of ancient social education is directly related to the natural ecological environment in which people live. It originated directly from the most recent way of life for the ancient ancestors, so its content covers all areas of social life. "The corpse of the rule of the prince" has a record about the life of the original clan society: the world of the sacred people, the world is more water, so the people are fishing; the world of sorrow, the world is more beasts, so teach to hunt. Fishing and hunting is one of the oldest ways of making a living. It has retained a lot of traces in this area in the Neolithic cultural sites in China. Combining the legendary ancient education with the spread and application of livelihood techniques helps to illustrate the characteristics of ancient education. At the same time, the legendary ancient education also reflects the main characteristics of the regional clan culture at that time, as well as the main forms of knowledge and culture communication between clan tribes and clan. </p>
  <p>A tribe living in a lush forest will invent and master hunting techniques earlier; a tribe living in the plains will invent and master agricultural production techniques earlier; and living in floods that are prone to flooding The tribe will be forced to explore ways to manage water damage. Legend has it that he was appointed as an agronomist and was responsible for teaching the tribal people about the techniques of planting alfalfa and other crops. His tribes lived in the loess plateau where the land was fertile and suitable for alfalfa growth. The tribes live in the Yellow River basin where floods have been flooding all year round. Other ancient figures, such as deeds, monks, and ancestors, who are responsible for certain types of education, actually represent clan tribes with certain cultural expertise. The distinctive features of this regional culture reflect the diversity and imbalance of Chinese prehistoric culture, and the trade contacts of barter in different regions, the migration of clan tribes, the emergence and development of extra-ethnic marriages, etc. Communication has become an important channel for technical and cultural exchanges among clan tribes. This kind of communication is derived from the so-called "education" of the ancient times. The important reason is that the earliest concept of education in China includes not only the spread and spread of the Central Plains culture in the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River, but also the surrounding minority tribal groups. Subordination and naturalization of the Huaxia ethnic group. Therefore, war and conquest have also been given the function of promoting education. </p>
  <p>"Lv's Spring and Autumn. Calling Class" is called levying the Miao people, in order to change the customs of the wind; 禹 禹 曹 曹 曹 魏 魏 魏 魏 曹 曹 曹 曹 曹 曹 曹 曹 曹 曹 曹 曹 曹 曹 曹 曹 曹 曹 曹 曹 曹 曹 曹 曹 曹 曹 曹 曹 曹The statement reflects the broad meaning and function of education in the primitive clan society. </p>
</div>
<h2 class="h2"><span>5</span>logical starting point</h2>
<div class="content4"><br>
  <p>The logical starting point of education is naturally the emergence of human society. The transition from jealousy to human beings is due to productive labor, and the main mechanism of brain and hand as the core is gradually formed in labor. The brain can think and the hand can operate. This makes people different from ordinary animals and becomes "high-level animals." With the main mechanism, it is possible to become a subject with practical cognitive ability, and human beings can promote themselves to understanding and transformation. The subject of the objective world, thus turning the objective world into the object of human transformation and understanding. To understand and transform the objective world requires the ability of the main body. Human society is a form of self-existence created by human beings in social practice. </p>
