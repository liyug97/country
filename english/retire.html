Since January 2011, China’s one-time subsidy income for early retirement of individuals has been subject to personal income tax in accordance with the “salary, salary income” project. Relevant government authorities have continuously released the policy intention of retirement retirement. According to opinion polls, more than half of the respondents objected to extending the retirement age, and most of them advocate retirement at the required age. </p>
</div>
<h2 class="h2"><span>1</span> retirement age</h2>
<div class="content">
  <p>According to the Interim Measures on the Retirement and Retirement of Workers issued by the State Council in June 1978 and the Interim Measures for the Resettlement of Old and Weak Vulnerable Persons (Guo Fa [1978] No. 104), the following situations may be Retirement:</p>
  <p>(1) Male cadres and workers are 60 years old, female cadres are 55 years old, female workers are 50 years old, and they are working or working for 10 years. </p>
  <p>(2) Workers engaged in underground, high altitude, high temperature, heavy physical labor and other harmful health workers, male 55 years old, female 45 years old, continuous working or working years of 10 years. </p>
  <p>(3) Employees who are 50 years of age, 45 years of age, or have a working age of 10 years or more, have been certified by the hospital and confirmed by the labor appraisal committee, and have completely lost their ability to work. </p>
  <p>(4) Due to work disability, the hospital has proved that the worker (confirmed by the labor appraisal committee) is completely incapacitated. According to the Regulations on Industrial Injury Insurance (implemented on January 1, 2004), employees are identified as disabled from Grade 1 to Grade 4 due to work disability, retaining labor relations, withdrawing from work, and enjoying disability allowance on a monthly basis. After the injured workers reach the retirement age and apply for retirement, they will stop the disability allowance and enjoy the basic pension insurance. If the basic endowment insurance benefits are lower than the disability allowance, the work injury insurance fund will make up the difference. </p>

<h2 class="h2"><span>2</span>About rehiring</h2>
<div class="content1">
  <p>China has begun to enter an ageing society. With physical health, increased knowledge, and changing concepts, more and more retirees are entering the job market, rehiring, re-starting, volunteering, volunteering, or re-employment. . A richer retirement life will become the norm and will have a major impact on social operations. </p>
  <p>[1] "Notice on Several Issues Concerning the Implementation of the Labor Contract System", Ministry of Labor [1996] No. 354. </p>
  <p>13. When the retirees who have enjoyed the pension insurance benefits are re-employed, the employer shall sign a written agreement with them to clarify the rights and obligations of the work content, remuneration, medical care, and labor insurance benefits during the employment period. </p>
  <p>The statutory retirement age stipulated in China's labor law is 60 years old for males. Workers who reach this age should be retirees and enjoy social pension insurance. However, China's law does not explicitly stipulate that employers and workers over 60 years of age have established employment relations, which is a labor relationship (non-labor relations). Article 44 (2) of the Labor Contract Law stipulates that if a worker begins to enjoy basic pension insurance benefits according to law, the labor contract is terminated. Article 7 of the Interpretation of the Supreme People's Court on Several Issues Concerning the Application of Laws in the Trial of Labor Dispute Cases (S3), which came into effect on September 14, 2010, stipulates that: employers and their employers have already enjoyed pension benefits or received pensions according to law. If a person has a dispute over employment and files a lawsuit with the people's court, the people's court shall handle it according to the labor service relationship. </p>
  <p>[2] Reply of the General Office of the Ministry of Labor to the "Request for the Implementation of Several Issues Concerning the Labor Contract System", Lao Fafa [1997] No. 88</p>
  <p>Second, about the re-employment of retirees. All localities should adopt appropriate control measures to give priority to the employment and re-employment of workers of the appropriate age. For the retired persons who have been re-employed and have been entitled to pension insurance, according to the Ministry of Labor’s Notice on Several Issues Concerning the Implementation of the Labor Contract System (Luo Bufa [1996] No. 354), the employment agreement can be clearly defined. Rights and obligations such as work content, remuneration, medical care, and labor protection treatment. The retirees and employers shall perform their obligations in accordance with the terms of the employment agreement. If the employment agreement stipulates that the written agreement shall be terminated in advance, it shall be handled in accordance with the agreement between the two parties. If not agreed, it shall be settled through consultation. The removal of the retirees employment agreement cannot be carried out in accordance with Article 28 of the Labour Code. If there is a dispute between the retirees and the employer, if it is within the scope of the labor dispute arbitration committee, the labor dispute arbitration committee shall accept the case. </p>
  <p>The two parties agree on their rights, obligations, such as work content, remuneration, medical care, and labor protection. For social security, housing provident fund, etc., it may or may not be subsidized. According to the company's own situation, the re-hiring personnel will contribute a lot. If the enterprise is inseparable from negotiating subsidies, the re-employed personnel may or may not have the original subsidy agreement. Subsidies can also be rejected. </p>
  <p>[3] According to the provisions of Article 44(2) of the Labor Contract Law, laborers begin to enjoy the pension insurance treatment (ie, apply for retirement) and terminate the labor contract. Therefore, after the employee retires, he is rehired by the employer. The relationship formed by the two parties is not a labor relationship and is not subject to adjustment by the Labor Contract Law. The rights and obligations of both parties are agreed upon by both parties. </p>
  <p>[4] If an injury accident occurs at the time of re-employment, if there is an agreement, it will be handled according to the agreement; if there is no agreement, it will be forwarded according to the General Office of the State Council of the CPC Central Committee, the Central Organization Department, the Central Propaganda Department, and the Central United Front Department. Article 4 of the Notice of the Ministry of Personnel, the Ministry of Science and Technology, the Ministry of Labor and Social Security, the General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army, and the China Association for Science and Technology's Opinions on Further Playing the Role of Retired Operational Technicians>: "Retired professional and technical personnel are employed during work, due to work In the event of occupational injury, the employer shall properly handle the relevant treatment standards for work-related injury insurance; if there is a dispute between the occupational injury and the employer due to work, it may be handled through civil action."</p>
  <p>For retired workers, the claim of the heirs of the person or the retired laborer must not only focus on the amount of personal injury compensation, but also comprehensively consider all relevant circumstances of the retired laborer to obtain more comprehensive compensation. Project and compensation requirements to protect their legitimate rights and interests. The details are as follows:</p>
  <p>According to Article 17 of the Social Security Law of China: "Anyone who participates in basic endowment insurance may receive funeral grants and pensions due to illness or non-work-related death." Therefore, the original employer of retired laborers If the unit has paid social security for the law, if the retired laborer dies due to illness or other non-work-related work, his surviving family has the right to receive the corresponding funeral grant and pension from the social security agency. The specific amount is stipulated by the local social security department. </p>
  <p>It should be noted that if the original employer of the retired laborer fails to pay social security for the employee, the retired laborer cannot obtain the above fee. However, according to the provisions of the judicial interpretation of the labor law: after the retirement of the laborer, the original employer who has not participated in the social insurance co-ordination disputes due to the pursuit of pension, medical expenses, work injury insurance benefits and other social insurance premiums. The people's court shall accept the case. If the employer fails to apply for social insurance procedures for the employer and the social insurance agency cannot re-submit it, it may not be entitled to social insurance benefits, and if the employer claims compensation for the loss, the people's court shall accept the case. Therefore, in this case, the survivors of retired workers can claim pension losses, funeral allowances and pensions, and medical expenses after retirement from the employer through litigation. </p>
