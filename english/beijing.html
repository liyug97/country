      <h2>Name test</h2>
      <p> The Forbidden City is also known as the Forbidden City. In ancient China, the planning concept of "Heaven and Man are one" was used, and the stars in the sky corresponded to the planning of the capital to highlight the legitimacy of the regime and the supremacy of the imperial power. The Emperor of Heaven lived in Ziwei Palace, and the emperor of the earth claimed to be the "Tibezi" who was ordered by the heavens. His residence should symbolize the Ziwei Palace to correspond with the Emperor of Heaven, and the "Han Han Shu" contains "There is the Ziwei Palace, which is the residence of God." Also. The king of the palace, like it." Ziwei, Zixiao, Zigong, etc. became the name of the imperial palace. Since the feudal palace was a forbidden place in ancient times, ordinary people could not enter, so it was called "the forbidden." However, in the early Ming Dynasty, it was called "Imperial City", and the direct name of "Forbidden City" began around the middle and late Ming Dynasty.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="content1">
      <h2>Construction principle</h2>
      <p>The Forbidden City is strictly constructed in accordance with the principle of imperial construction in the “Zhou Li·Kao Gong Ji” in the “Zhou Zhao Hou Shi, Zuo Zu You She”. Throughout the Forbidden City, in the architectural arrangement, the form changes, the ups and downs of the way, combined into a whole. Functionally in line with the hierarchy of the feudal society. At the same time, it achieves the artistic effect of left and right balance and physical changes. </p>
      <p>The roof form of Chinese architecture is rich and colorful. In the Forbidden City building, there are more than 10 different types of roofs. Take the three halls as an example, the roofs are different. The roof of the Forbidden City is full of glazed tiles. The main hall is mainly yellow. Green is used for the construction of the Emperor's residential area. Other blue, purple, black, green, and malachite green, sapphire blue and other colorful glass, used in gardens or glass walls. On both sides of the roof of the Hall of Supreme Harmony, there are glazed beasts on both ends of the ridge, which swallow the ridges firmly and forcefully. The kiss beast is beautifully shaped and is a component and a decoration. A part of the tile shape shapes the three-dimensional animal image of dragons and phoenixes, lions and seahorses, symbolizing auspiciousness and majesty. These components play a decorative role in the building.

      <h2>Construction process</h2>
      <p> Beijing was originally the land of Yan Wang Zhu Xi. After the Battle of Jing Dynasties, the first year of Yongle (1403), Li Zhigang, the rites of the Ministry of Rites, said that Yanjing Beiping was the emperor's "land of Longxing", and should follow the example of Ming Taizu's practice against Fengyang. Ming Chengzu vigorously promoted the status of Yanjing Beiping House, with Beiping as Beijing and Beipingping as Shuntianfu, known as "walking in". At the same time, people began to relocate to enrich Beijing; they were forced to move to Beijing, including locals, wealthy people in the south of the Yangtze River, and Shanxi businessmen. </p>
      <p> In the four years of Yongle (1406), Ming Chengzu was built on the foundation of the Nanjing Imperial Palace (Nanjing Imperial Palace) to build the Beijing Imperial Palace and the city. Zhu Xixian sent personnel to go all over the country to mine precious wood and stone, and then transported to Beijing. It was only 11 years since it was ready for work. The precious nanmu grows in the mountains and mountains, and the people venture into the mountains and collect trees. Many people have lost their lives. Later generations left “a thousand in the mountains and five in the mountains” to describe the cost of life. It is also very difficult to mine the stone of the palace. Now the largest tanzanite in the back of the temple, was mined in Fangshan, southwest of Beijing. The history book records the scene when it was transported: tens of thousands of workers digging a well every two miles on both sides of the road. When the temperature was low enough in the cold winter, it poured into the ice channel from the well and spent 28 days. Then I was sent to the palace. In addition, it is necessary to burn the bricks used in the royal buildings in Suzhou, the bricks, and the Linqing in Shandong will also deliver the tribute bricks to Beijing. </p>
      <p>Yongle Seven Years (1409), Ming Chengzu used Beijing as the base for the Northern Expedition and began to build Changling in Changping near Beijing. [16] He built his own mausoleum in Beijing instead of Nanjing, proving that Ming Chengzu had made up his mind to move to the capital. </p>
      <p>In the 14th year of Yongle (1416), Ming Chengzu called the group of officials to formally discuss the issue of moving to Beijing. For the ministers who raised objections, Ming Chengzu was dismissed or severely punished, and no one dared to oppose the move to the capital. [17] The following year, the Beijing Forbidden City, with the Nanjing Forbidden City as a template, officially started construction. In the 18th year of Yongle (1420), the Beijing Imperial Palace and Beijing City were completed. The Beijing Imperial Palace is based on the Nanjing Imperial Palace and is slightly larger. The newly-built Beijing City is forty-five miles long and is in a regular square shape, which is in line with the ideal capital of the Zhou Li·Kao Gong Ji. Ming Chengzu was officially moved to the capital, and Jinling Yingtianfu was changed to Nanjing, and Beijing Shuntianfu was changed to Beijing. However, there were still six central institutions in Nanjing, called Nanjing, and Nanjing as the capital.</p>

      <h2> Ming Dynasty</h2>
      <p>After the completion of the Forbidden City, the history of the Ming and Qing Dynasties for more than 500 years includes the activities of the emperor, the hierarchy, the power struggle, and the religious sacrifices. In the 18th year of Yongle (1420), the Beijing Palace was completed. The next year, a fire broke out and the first three halls were burned. In the orthodox five years (1440), the former three halls and the dry palace were rebuilt. Tianshun three years (1459), building Xiyuan. Experienced Yongle, Hongxi, Xuande, orthodox four generations, for 20 years. </p>
      <p>Jiajing thirty-six years (1557), the Forbidden City fire, the former three halls, Fengtianmen, Wenwulou, and Wumen were all burned. It was only after 40 years of Jiajing (1561) that all reconstruction was completed. During the Jiajing period, the names of the three halls of the Forbidden City were changed to Emperor Temple, Zhongji Temple and Jianji Temple.</p>
      <p> In the twenty-five years of Wanli (1597), the Forbidden City blazes and burns the former three halls and the third house. The rebuilding project was completed in the 7th year of the Apocalypse (1627). In the Ming Dynasty, the Qing Palace was the main palace of the emperor and the main venue for political activities. Since the Yongle Emperor Zhu Xi to the Chongzhen Emperor Zhu Youzhen, a total of 14 emperors have lived here. Because the palace was tall and the space was too wide, the emperor was divided into several rooms when he lived here. According to records, in the Ming Dynasty, there were 9 warm pavilions in the Qing Palace, which were divided into two floors. A total of 27 beds were placed, and then they were able to enter. Because there are more beds in the room, few people know about the emperor’s sleep every night, in case of any accident. Although the emperor lived in a palace-like palace and was guarded against strictness, he still could not sit still. According to records, after the "壬寅宫变" in Jiajing, Shizong moved to Xiyuan and did not dare to return to the Qing Palace to live. The "Red Pill Case" of the Wanli Emperor of the Wanli Emperor, the "Red Pill Case" that happened to be commemorated by the Empress Dowager, and the "Moving Palace Case" that moved to Renshou Temple as a queen after the election of Tai Changyi, all occurred in the Qing Palace. The Qing Dynasty in the Ming Dynasty also served as the mourning place of the emperor.</p>

      <p> The Forbidden City is located in the center of Beijing. The layout is based on the principle of "Zhou Li, Kao Gong Ji Ji": "Zuo Zu, You She, Face, and Market". The building is located on the central axis of Beijing City, which is eight kilometers long from north to south. Today, the Palace of Culture and Culture in front of the Forbidden City, the Ming and Qing Dynasties is the emperor's ancestral ancestral temple; the right front of the Zhongshan Park is the social sect of the emperor to worship the earth gods and the valley gods; there is a place where the courtiers work in front; there is a market for people to trade. The north side of the Forbidden City in Beijing is the Longevity Hill, and the south is the Jinshui River, which coincides with the ancient palace's principle of “negative yin and yang, and Qiqi for peace”. Wanshou Mountain is an artificial mountain built for the construction of the imperial city Feng Shui. At the beginning of the Ming Dynasty, it was located in the former site of the Yanchun Pavilion in the Yuan Dynasty, and was built by excavating the mud of the moat and Nanhu. On the one hand, the construction of this mountain satisfies the principle of “negative yin” in the imperial city, and on the other hand, it has also preserved the feng shui of the former dynasty. Therefore, the Longevity Mountain is also known as the “town of mountains”. The layout of Beijing Sijiu City is the two dragons to protect the Forbidden City. According to the ancient Chinese astrology theory, the purple micro-star (ie, the North Star) is located in Zhongtian, which is the residence of the Emperor of Heaven.

      <h2> Overall collection</h2>
      <p>There are a large number of precious cultural relics in the Forbidden City in Beijing. According to statistics, there are a total of 1,052,653 pieces, collectively referred to as 1 million pieces of cultural relics, accounting for 1/6 of the total number of Chinese national cultural relics.

    </div>
    <h2 class="h2"><span>5</span>Cultural relic protection</h2>
    <div class="content12">
      <p>In 2015, the Forbidden City and the Institute of Architectural History of the China Academy of Architectural Design and Research jointly produced the "General Plan for the Protection of the Forbidden City" and consulted. The protection of the "Planning" is the Forbidden City and its property ownership units, including the Forbidden City, Duanmen, Da Gao Xuan Temple, Huang Shizhen and the Auditorium of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. There are 5 Ming and Qing Dynasty royal buildings, with a total area of 106 hectares. The scope of the plan is equivalent to the World Cultural Heritage buffer zone of the Forbidden City, which is the area surrounding the Forbidden City. It is expected to achieve its goal by 2025. </p>
      <p>The National Palace Museum receives 15 million visitors a year, ranking first among all museums and world cultural heritage in the world. Since June 13, 2015, the National Palace Museum has restricted the daily limit of 80,000 people and real-name ticket sales. </p>

    <h2 class="h2"><span>6</span>Value of action</h2>
    <div class="content16">
      <h2>Museum role</h2>
      <p> The founding of the Palace Museum has two meanings: one is the victory of the democratic revolution, a fatal blow to the restoration forces; the other is a great achievement in the history of Chinese culture and art. In the 14th year of the Republic of China (1925), the inauguration ceremony of the Palace Museum was held on October 10. The museum is an institution that collects, researches, displays and preserves objects for the purpose of cultural education. It will become a symbol of the monarchy and a precious cultural relic that can only be enjoyed by the emperor and become a common wealth of the whole nation. When the Palace Museum was established, it formulated the "Provisions of the Provisional Council of the Palace Museum." In the 17th year of the Republic of China (1928), the National Government promulgated the "Organization Law of the Palace Museum", which was the first law on museums in Chinese history, and later promulgated the "Regulations of the Palace Museum of the Republic of China." These two documents are of great significance in the history of the development of the Palace Museum, marking the beginning of the museum's maturity and the beginning of the Chinese museum's career.</p>

    <div class="content17">
      <h2> Heritage value</h2>
      <p> In 1987, the Forbidden City in Beijing was included in the World Cultural Heritage. The World Heritage Organization’s evaluation of the Forbidden City is: “The Forbidden City is the highest power center in China for more than five centuries. It has become a priceless Chinese civilization in the Ming and Qing Dynasties with garden landscapes and huge buildings of 9,000 rooms that house furniture and handicrafts. Historical testimony."</p>
      <p>The Forbidden City has become a world cultural heritage, which has deepened people's understanding of the value of the ancient buildings of the Forbidden City. The Forbidden City represents the culture that has become history, and it has the outer shell of the palace culture. At the same time, it represents the mainstream culture at that time. After a long period of historical screening and accumulation, of course, it cannot be simply summarized by “feudalism and backwardness”. The Forbidden City and the Museum are not irrelevant or antagonistic, but organically unified and complement each other. Combining them, we can see that the Palace Museum is one of the few in the world with art museums, architectural museums, historical museums, palace culture museums, etc., and conforms to the internationally recognized basic principles of “original protection” and “original display”. Museum and cultural heritage. The basic spirit of the world cultural heritage is the diversity of culture. From the perspective of world cultural heritage, people strive to explore and understand the outstanding and universal value of the Forbidden City. </p>
      <p> The introduction of the concept of "cultural heritage" has broken through the limitations of the traditional "relics" concept, strengthened the environmental awareness and sharing consciousness of the heritage, and the concept that management and protection must be undertaken by the whole society to promote people from the "Great Palace Museum". The concept is to look at the protection of the Forbidden City. This is fully reflected in the protection of the Forbidden City. It is necessary not only to protect the Forbidden City itself, but also to protect its environment. In the past, I only paid attention to the protection of the Forbidden City. Later, I realized that the moat that is connected with the Imperial Palace is also an integral part of the Imperial Palace. It must be governed. So there was a moat that invested 600 million yuan in the 1990s and took three years. Changed the long-standing existence of dirty, chaotic, and poor appearance. According to the requirements of the World Heritage Committee, a “buffer zone” must be delineated around the cultural heritage site to protect the original historical features and environment around it. In May 2007, the "Beijing Document" adopted at the "International Symposium on the Concept and Practice of Conservation of Cultural Relics in East Asia" held in Beijing gave high praise to the policies and principles of Chinese heritage protection and the restoration of World Heritage sites such as the Forbidden City.

      <h2>academic value </h2>
      <p> The Forbidden City was proposed by the Palace Museum in 2003. It is a science based on the Forbidden City in Beijing and its rich collections. The study of the Forbidden City mainly includes the Forbidden City Palace Complex, the Cultural Relics Collection, the Palace Historical and Cultural Relics, the Ming and Qing Dynasties Archives, the Qing Palace Classics and the History of the Palace Museum. It has rich and profound academic connotations. The Forbidden City culture is a royal culture centered on the emperor, the imperial power and the palace. The introduction and establishment of the Forbidden City will bring its research into a conscious stage and improve the level of the study of the Forbidden City as a whole. </p>
      <p>Viewing the Forbidden City from the perspective of the Forbidden City, not only recognizes the important value of the ancient palace building and palace cultural relics, but also has the same important significance in seeing the historical remains of the palace; more importantly, ancient architecture, cultural relics collection, history The remains and the people and things that have happened here are an inseparable cultural whole. This understanding is an important basis for the creation of the Forbidden City, and it is also conducive to further digging the historical and cultural connotations of the Forbidden City. This holistic nature of the Forbidden City culture has also brought an academic home to the Qing dynasty cultural relics and archives that have been scattered outside the hospital, overseas, and abroad. Based on this, the exchanges and cooperation between the two museums of the Palace Museum in academic research are inevitable, and the artificial barrier can only be temporary. In fact, this exchange is also constantly developing.</p>
