<h3>Layer height</h3>
  <p>The vertical distance between the upper and lower floors or the floor and the ground. It is also the height of a building. In the "Residential Standards for Residential Building Modulus" issued in 1987, the parameters for the height of brick-concrete structure residential buildings are clearly defined as: 2.6 m, 2.7 m, 2.8 m. </p>
<h3>Indoor net height</h3>
  <p>The vertical distance between the floor or floor to the bottom of the upper slab or the bottom of the sill. The relationship between net height and floor height can be expressed by the formula: net height = floor height - floor thickness. That is, the difference between the height of the floor and the thickness of the floor is called "net height." </p>
  <p>Indoor net height regulations:</p>
  <p>According to the "Residential Design Code" promulgated by the Ministry of Construction on March 25, 1999, the indoor net height refers to the vertical distance between the floor or the ground to the bottom of the upper slab or the bottom of the ceiling. Among them: the indoor height of the bedroom and living room (hall) should not be lower than 2.40 meters, the local net height should not be less than 2.10 meters, and its area should not be more than 1/3 of the indoor use area. When using the space inside the sloping roof as the bedroom and living room (hall), the indoor height of the 1/2 area should not be less than 2.10 meters. The indoor height of the kitchen and bathroom should not be lower than 2.20 meters. The lower surface of the horizontal cross-pipe of the kitchen and the bathroom and the floor and the ground clearance shall not be less than 1.90 m, and shall not affect the opening of the door and window sash. </p>
  <h3>Residential open room</h3>
  <p>The open space of the house is the width of the house. In the "Residential Standards for Residential Building Modulus" promulgated in 1987, there are strict regulations on the design of residential openings. The following parameters are often used in the opening of brick-concrete residential buildings: 2.1 m, 2.4 m, 2.7 m, 3.0 m, 3.3 m, 3.6 m, 3.9 m, 4.2 m. </p>

<h2>Is facing problems</h2>
<p>The current regulation of the real estate industry, with the main direction of suppressing investment and speculation, is the cure for the standard rather than the cure. The simple suppression, the consequence is to reduce supply, under the current interest pattern, will affect the government's finances, and thus difficult to sustain. There is a large amount of hot money in the society, which is an objective existence (only nearly one trillion in Wenzhou City), and it will come back when there is a storm. Once back, the price is still uncontrollable. Therefore, the fundamental strategy is to increase housing supply, but only increase the supply of affordable housing and the supply of commercial housing.

	<h2 class="h2"><span>2</span> safeguard system</h2>
	<div class="content4"><br>
	  <p>"Homestead" and "welfare housing" are a specific form of housing security system. They are systems that guarantee "everyone has a living" at a low level of productivity. Relying on the market to allocate housing resources does not mean that everyone can only rely on their own income to buy a house. It does not mean that everyone can only rely on market competition and independent decentralized decision-making to obtain housing. In the market economy, in order to ensure that everyone has a house, the government must implement some special policy measures to help groups that rely solely on the market to solve housing problems. The general term for this policy system is called the housing security system. The housing security system and unemployment protection, old-age security, medical security, etc. are all part of the social security system. </p>
	<p>The housing security system, to put it simply, is that in social development, people who can't afford a house have to protect their houses. This is the minimum goal of a civilized society. Because housing is a necessary condition for human survival. This is a "public product" that the government must provide under the market economy. </p>
	<p>Under the conditions of China's socialist market economy, there are various forms of housing security. The villagers built their own houses on the collectively divided "homestead". The citizens are classified and resolved: high-income people buy commercial housing for the market; low-income people buy affordable housing or buy "second-restricted housing"; the lowest-income earners rent low-rent housing provided by the government. </p>
	 <h2>Connotation</h2>
	<p>From the reality, China's housing security has the following connotations: (1) Housing provident fund. (2) Housing currency subsidies. (3) Economically affordable housing. (4) Low-rent housing. (5) "Two restricted rooms". That is, ordinary commercial housing with limited price and limited area. </p>
	<h2>meaning</h2>
	<p>The above aspects are only for general housing security. China is a big country with uneven development. Starting from specific national conditions, housing security also needs special policies for special situations. For example, in the process of transferring a large number of rural surplus laborers to cities and towns, how to solve their housing problems; in the old city reconstruction and real estate development, a large number of house demolition caused some low-income relocated households to be unable to buy back new commercial housing; the old industrial base Such as the housing unemployment problem in areas with high unemployment rate and housing improvement rate. These issues are all aspects that urgently require us to study in depth and improve as soon as possible. </p>

	<h2 class="h2"><span>3</span>Second Housing Reform</h2>
<div class="content6"><br>
  <p>The core content of China's second housing reform is to establish housing as a quasi-public product. The basic direction is to provide housing and housing services by the government. To sum it up, it is "three kinds of housing systems, three types of land supply methods, and three teams participate" (three three systems). </p>
  <h2>Three housing systems</h2>
    <p>The three housing systems refer to affordable housing systems for low-income people, public housing and public rental housing systems for middle-income families, and commodity housing systems for high-income families. The corresponding three types of land supply methods are also provided by the government for the allocation of land, the "four fixed two competitions" bidding land and the commercial housing "bid". Among them, public housing implementation of land price, fixed house standard, fixed tax rate, fixed 5% profit rate, competitive price, competitive construction plan four fixed two ways, is a necessary condition for the realization of the second housing reform, the fundamental purpose is In order to solve the sandwich layer problem of the middle class. </p>
  <h2>Type of housing</h2>
    <p>There are many kinds of houses, which are mainly divided into high-end residences, ordinary houses, apartment houses, TOWNHOUSE, villas, etc. </p>
    <p>(1) According to the height of the building, it is mainly divided into low-rise, multi-storey, small high-rise, high-rise, super high-rise, etc.</p>
    <p>Low-rise residential buildings mainly refer to (one household) detached houses, (two households) detached houses and (multi-family) townhouses. Compared with multi-storey and high-rise residences, low-rise residences have the most natural affinity (which often has a courtyard for residents), which is suitable for children or the elderly; there is less interference between residents and a pleasant living atmosphere. Although this kind of dwelling is popular among residents, it is limited by the objective conditions of land price and utilization efficiency, high political status and supporting facilities, scale and location. </p>
    <p>Multi-storey homes are mainly used for vertical traffic on public stairs and are one of the most representative urban residential houses. Compared with middle and high-rise (small high-rise) and high-rise residential buildings, it has certain advantages:</p>
    <p>1) In construction investment, multi-story homes do not need to increase investment in elevators, high-pressure pumps, and public walkways, as in mid-rise and high-rise buildings. </p>
      <p>2) In the design of the apartment, the design space of the multi-storey residential building is relatively large, and the living comfort is high. </p>
  <p>3) In the construction of structures, multi-storey houses usually adopt brick-concrete structure, so the construction cost of multi-storey houses is generally low. </p>
  <p>But multi-storey homes also have shortcomings, mainly in:</p>
  <p>1) The living conditions of the ground floor and the top floor are not ideal. The safety and lightness of the bottom floor households are poor, and the toilets are easy to overflow with the smell; the top tenants are inconvenient because they do not have an elevator. In addition, the roof is poor in heat insulation and water resistance. </p>
  <p>2) It is difficult to innovate. Due to the design and construction process stereotypes, multi-storey houses are difficult to innovate in terms of structure, building materials selection, and space layout, forming the drawbacks of "one thousand floors and one thousand homes." If you want to innovate, you need to increase your investment and lose the advantage of price and cost. </p>
  <p>Multi-storey houses have many types of planes, and the basic types are ladder type, corridor type and independent unit type. </p>
  <p>Small high-rise residential buildings mainly refer to collection houses of 7 to 10 storeys. In terms of height, it has a multi-story residential atmosphere, but it is a lower high-rise residence, so it is called a small high-rise. For the small high-rises launched by the market, it seems to be the middle of a multi-level and high-level. This small high-rise has its own characteristics compared to multi-storey houses:</p>
  <p>1) The building volume ratio is higher than that of multi-storey dwellings, saving land, and the investment cost of real estate developers is lower. </p>
  <p>2) Most of the small high-rise residential buildings adopt reinforced concrete structures. From the perspective of the layout of the building structures, most of them adopt the slab structure, which has a large design space. </p>
  <p>3) Due to the design of the elevator, the floor is not very high, which increases the comfort of living. However, due to the limitation of the floor area ratio, the price of small high-rises is generally higher than that of high-rise residential buildings in the same location, which requires developers to pay more attention to improving quality. </p>
  <p>(2) According to the structure of the building, it is mainly divided into brick-wood structure, brick-concrete structure, steel-concrete frame structure, steel-mixed scissors wall structure, steel-concrete frame-scissor wall structure, steel structure and so on. </p>
  <p>(3) Classified by building type, mainly classified into low-rise residential buildings, multi-storey residential buildings, middle and high-rise residential buildings, high-rise residential buildings, and other forms of residential buildings. </p>
  <p>(4) Classified by house type, it is mainly divided into ordinary unit type residence, apartment type residence, duplex house, penthouse house, garden house type house, small house type house (super small house type) and so on. </p>
  <p>(5) According to the housing policy attributes, it is mainly divided into low-rent housing, purchased public housing (house-to-house), affordable housing, and residential cooperatives to raise funds. </p>
