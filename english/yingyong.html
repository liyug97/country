        <p>Supercomputer is a kind of computer with the strongest function, the fastest computing speed and the largest storage capacity. It is mostly used in the country's high-tech fields and cutting-edge technology research. It is an important symbol of the country's scientific and technological development level and comprehensive national strength. A country's high-performance supercomputer is directly related to the international people's livelihood and national security. Supercomputers play a crucial role in almost all fields of national economy and people's livelihood. </p>
        <p>1, supercomputer application science to promote the development of the times </p>
        <p> supercomputers use their powerful data processing capabilities to help people change the way they understand the natural world and provide great benefits to society. It simulates the atmosphere, climate and ocean and can accurately predict earthquakes and tsunamis. To better understand tornadoes and hurricanes, or to decipher the power of geomagnetic storms, Yellowstone supercomputers and NWSC will bring better predictions and better protect the public economy. Used for complex meteorological analysis and processing global meteorological satellite data. Supercomputer's fast data processing capability can predict the global weather, centralize data processing, quantitative analysis, modeling and analysis of meteorological satellite reconnaissance information.。

        <p>2. in the field of supercomputer application and production, save human resources </p>
          <p> using the powerful computing density of supercomputers, supercomputers are used to process and analyze data of underground coal mining, aerial work, blasting work and oil exploration in high-risk industries with high accident rate and great threat to life safety. The calculation density here refers to the calculation capability of the supercomputer in a certain volume and area, which is the embodiment of calculation accuracy and calculation capability. For example, the Dawn 4000L supercomputer in 2007 played a key role in the discovery of the 1 billion ton Bohai Bay Jidong Nanbao oil field, while the subsequent application of the Dawn 5000A supercomputer further reached an exploration depth of several thousand meters underground. </p>
        <p>3, applied to medical pharmacy, advanced manufacturing, artificial intelligence and other emerging fields </p>
        <p> bioinformatics has become a new application field of supercomputing. for example, supercomputers are indispensable for processing massive data generated in the process of human genome sequencing. In the medical field, supercomputers are also used to simulate the working mechanism of various organs of the human body and various biochemical reactions in the human body. The development of a new drug usually takes about 15 years from many steps of development and testing, while the use of supercomputers can simulate drug development, therapeutic effects and adverse reactions, thus shortening the development cycle of new drugs by 3-5 years and significantly reducing the development cost. In addition, with the development of computer technology, with the support of supercomputers, the key problems in major science and application fields have been solved, and the rapid development of related fields has been promoted. Other emerging fields such as artificial intelligence, in-depth study, bio-medicine, genetic engineering, financial analysis and so on also have a large number of applications.
