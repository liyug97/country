        The sea trial work </h3>
        <h4>3000 meters sea trial </h4>
        <p> since August 2009, the "jiaolong" manned submersible has organized and carried out 1,000-meter and 3,000-meter sea trials. From May 31 to July 18, 2010, "Jiaolong" manned submersible has achieved great success in the 3000-meter-class sea test in the South China Sea. A total of 17 dives have been completed, including 7 dives through 2000 meters, 4 dives through 3000 meters, and the maximum dives reach 3,759 meters, exceeding the global average depth of 3,682 meters. It has also created a record of 9 hours and 3 minutes of underwater and submarine operations, verifying the various performance and functional indexes of "Jiaolong" manned submersible in 3000-meter-class water depth.
        </p>
        <h4>5000 sea trial </h4>
        <p> the 5000m sea trial is a key task in the marine technology field under the national high technology research and development plan (863 plan). entrusted by the Ministry of science and technology, organized by the state oceanic administration and implemented by COMRA, it aims to test and evaluate the technical improvement effect of the "jiaolong" manned submersible after the 3000m sea trial, as well as its safety performance and operation capability at a depth of 5000m, laying a foundation for further depth sea trials and future practical applications.
        </p>
        <p> a total of 96 researchers from 13 units took part in the sea trial. During the sea trial, all the members of the team completed 5 dives in the E1, E2 and E3 test sea areas in the eastern Pacific Ocean. A total of 8 people completed 15 dives with depths of 4027, 5057, 5188, 5184 and 5180 meters respectively. The submersibles have completed a number of bottom-sitting tests on the seabed. They have also carried out various operational tests and applications in the COMRA polymetallic nodule exploration contract area, such as seabed photography, camera shooting, seabed topography measurement, marine environmental parameter measurement, seabed fixed-point sampling, etc. They have completed various experimental tasks.
        </p>
        <p> The "Xiang Yanghong 09" carrying the "Jiaolong" has arrived at the northeast Pacific polymetallic nodule exploration contract area more than 300 nautical miles away from the third option area. According to the plan, it will go to sea in the early morning of the 28th. The specific time should be determined by the site command according to the weather and hull conditions at that time.
        </p>
        <p> this contract area is the preferred sea area for the "jiaolong" to hit a depth of 5000 meters. After arriving at the northeast Pacific polymetallic nodule exploration contract area on July 16, the sea trial headquarters was scheduled to conduct the first test on the afternoon of the 17th, but due to the heavy wind and waves in the test sea area, it was unable to meet the operation requirements. After consulting the "Jiaolong" sea trial leading group, the commander-in-chief of the sea trial site decided to move southward and finally chose the third alternative area with relatively good sea conditions.
