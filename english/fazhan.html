        <p>On April 12, 1961, Soviet cosmonaut Gagarin became the first person to enter space after flying around the earth on board the "east" spacecraft.  Since then, manned space flight has roughly gone through three stages.</p>
        <h4>Solve the problem of putting people into earth orbit and returning safely</h4>
        <img src="../images/舱外活动.jpg" width="170px">
        <p>Before entering space for the first time, humans launched unmanned spacecraft and biological satellites to verify the safety and reliability of manned space systems and ensure the success of manned space flight. After everything became mature, a manned spacecraft was finally launched. During the flight, astronauts completed manual orientation, posture adjustment, earth observation and earth photography, and conducted scientific research and extensive technical experiments in medicine, biology, etc. The first stage of manned space flight has proved that human beings can not only survive but also work effectively under such harsh environments as overload, weightlessness, vacuum and strong radiation, laying a solid foundation for future human beings to explore and develop space in a large scale, and its value is of milestone significance. </p>
        <h4> basic technology for developing manned space flight </h4>
        <p> such as the orbital maneuver flight of the spacecraft, the rendezvous and docking of the two spacecraft in space and the formation flight, to inspect the equipment and capability of astronauts' extravehicular activities, and also to carry out other scientific research work. At this stage, Soviet astronaut leonov and American astronaut E. H.White walked out of the spacecraft in spacesuits and carried out activities in space. On January 27, 1967, when the Apollo spacecraft was carrying out routine tests at cape Kennedy, three American astronauts died due to a sudden fire. On April 23, 1967, when the Soviet Union's Soyuz 1 spacecraft returned, komarov died due to parachute failure. These were major accidents in manned space flight.
        </p>
        <h4> development of experimental space station </h4>
        <p> to further investigate people's ability to live and work in space environment for a long time, and to use the unique space environment to conduct research and applied experiments in a variety of disciplines, such as biology, medicine, astronomy, material and process experiments, earth resource survey and military activities, etc. at the same time, to accumulate experience for the establishment of practical space stations. Participating in this phase of activities are space stations for astronauts to live and work for a long time, manned spacecraft to transport astronauts and return to earth, and cargo spacecraft to supply fuel for the space stations and necessities of life for astronauts, such as the Soviet union's "progress" cargo ship.
