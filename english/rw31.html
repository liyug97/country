      <div class="jingli-main"> <span>Study experience</span>
        <p>On September 7, 1930, Yuan Longping was born in Peking Union Medical College Hospital. </p>
        <p> from 1931 to 1936, he lived with his parents in Peiping, Tianjin, Jiujiang, Ganzhou and Hankou.
        </p>
        <p> from August 1936 to July 1938, I studied in Hankou rotary primary school.
        </p>
        <p> from August 1938 to January 1939, I studied in Hunan Hongyi primary school.
        </p>
        <p> from August 1939 to July 1942, I studied in Longmen Hao central primary school in Chongqing.
        </p>
        <p> from August 1942 to January 1943, I studied in Chongqing Fuxing junior high school.
        </p>
        <p> from February 1943 to January 1944, I studied in Ganjiang middle school in Chongqing.
        </p>
        <p> from February 1944 to may 1946, I studied in Chongqing erudite middle school.
        </p>
        <p> from August 1946 to January 1948, I attended high school in Hankou erudite middle school.
        </p>
        <p> in the summer vacation of 1947, he won the first place in the men's 100m freestyle in Hankou competition area when he was in the first grade of high school. He won the second place in the men's 100m freestyle in Hubei province.
        </p>
        <p> From February 1948 to April 1949, I attended high school in the affiliated high school of Nanjing Central University (now high school affiliated to nanjing normal university).
        </p>
        <p> from August 1949 to October 1950, I studied in the agronomy department of Xianghui college in xiaba, Beibei, Chongqing.
        </p>
        <p> from August 1949 to August 1953, the department of agriculture of southwest agricultural university majored in crops.
        </p>
        <p> from November 1950 to July 1953, the departments were reorganized and merged into the department of agronomy of Chongqing's newly-built southwest agricultural college, which continued for 3 years until graduation.
        </p>
        <p> In July 1951, Yuan Longping signed up for the air force in Southwest Agricultural College. He passed the physical examination and political examination. However, due to the need for college students to participate in economic construction, he did not join the army and continued to study in the school.
        </p>
        <span> rice research </span>
        <p> In August 1953, Yuan Longping graduated from the Department of Agriculture of Southwest Agricultural University (now Southwest University). Obey the national unified distribution and teach in Anjiang Agricultural School in Huaihua District of Hunan Province. In the same year, he was assigned to teach in the remote and backward Anjiang Agricultural School at the foot of Xuefeng Mountain in western Hunan.
        </p>
        <p> 1953.08-1971.01 teachers of Anjiang agricultural school in Hunan province.
        </p>
        <p> in July 1960, he accidentally discovered a special rice plant in the experimental field of the agricultural school. He used this strain of rice to test and found that its progeny had different properties. Because rice is self-pollinated and there will be no character separation, he deduced that it should be a natural hybrid rice. Then he manually removed the male flowers of rice with the same pistil and gave another variety of pollen to try to produce hybrid varieties.
        </p>
        <p> in the spring of 1961, he sowed the seeds of this mutant plant in the experimental field for starting a business. the results proved that the "stand out from the crowd" plant discovered in 1960 was a "natural hybrid rice". At that time, he was a teacher in an Jiang civilian school, but in the face of the severe famine at that time, he resolved to defeat the threat of hunger with agricultural science and technology and engage in the male sterility test of rice.
        </p>
        <p> on July 5, 1964, he found a "natural male sterile plant" in the experimental rice field. after artificial pollination, he produced hundreds of seeds of the first generation male sterile plant.
        </p>
        <p> In July 1965, Yuan Longping detected 6 sterile plants from more than 14,000 rice panicles one by one. In the following two years of sowing, 4 plants successfully propagated 1 ~ 2 generations. His research completely overturned the "asexual hybridization" theory of michurin and lysenko, the traditional classical theories, and deduced that rice also had hybridization advantages. The yield of hybrid rice can be greatly increased by cultivating male sterile line, male sterile maintainer line and male sterile restorer line.
        </p>
        <p> on February 22, 1964, he married Deng ze, an agricultural technology cadre.
        </p>
        <p> from 1964 to 1965, during the two-year rice flowering season, he and his research team conducted cross breeding experiments in rice fields. Six natural male sterile plants were found in the paddy field. After two years of observation and testing, he has a rich understanding of rice male sterile materials. according to the accumulated scientific data, he has been working for about 12 years after graduating from university and was published in the "scientific bulletin" no 4, vol. 17, 1966.
        </p>
        <p> in July 1965, among Nantes, Zaojing 4, Shengli indica and other rice varieties in the paddy field near anjiang agricultural school, more than 14,000 rice spikes were inspected one by one, and a total of 6 plants were found along with the sterile plants found last year. After two consecutive years of spring sowing and autumn turning, a total of 4 plants have propagated for 1 ~ 2 generations.
        </p>
        <p> on February 28, 1966, the first paper "male sterility of rice" was published in the fourth issue of volume 17 of the semimonthly science bulletin edited by the Chinese academy of sciences. In May, Comrade Zhao quartz, director of the Ninth Bureau of the State Science and Technology Commission, received great attention after learning the article "Male Sterility of Rice" published by Yuan Longping. In the name of the Ninth Bureau of the State Science and Technology Commission, he wrote to the Hunan Provincial Science and Technology Commission and Anjiang Agricultural University to support the research activities on male sterility of rice in Yuan Longping, pointing out that the research is of great significance and, if successful, will greatly increase the yield of rice. [11] In June, when the Cultural Revolution began, Yuan Longping was hit and the male sterility test of rice was forced to stop.
        </p>
        <p> In April 1967, Yuan Longping drafted the "Breeding Plan for Male Infertility Rice Lines in Anjiang Agricultural University" and submitted it to the Provincial Science and Technology Commission and Qianyang Regional Science and Technology Commission. In June, a research group on male sterility of rice was formally established at Qianyang Agricultural School (renamed Anjiang Agricultural School) composed of Yuan Longping, Li Bihu and Yin Huaqi.
        </p>
        <p> On April 30, 1968, Yuan Longping planted more than 700 rare seedlings of sterile materials in the No.7 field of Zhonggupan in Anjiang Agricultural School, covering an area of 133 square meters. On the evening of may 18, the sterile seedlings of zhonggu pan 7 field were completely uprooted and destroyed, which became an unsolved mystery. Yuan Longping was heartbroken. On the 4th day after the incident, five remaining seedlings were found in a waste well in the school and the experiment continued.
        </p>
        <p> In the winter of 1969, Yuan Longping, Li Bihu and Yin Huaqi waited until Yuanjiang County in Yunnan Province to speed up the reproduction of sterile materials.
        </p>
        <p> In the summer of 1970, Yuan Longping imported wild rice from Yunnan and planned to cross it in Jingxian County (Anjiang Agricultural College moved to Jingxian County again). However, it did not succeed because of lack of short light treatment. In autumn, Yuan Longping led the scientific research teams Li Bihu and Yin Huaqi to Hainan Island's Nanjiang Farm, Ya County, to conduct research experiments in Hainan with favorable conditions for three-season rice experiments, and to investigate the distribution of wild rice to technicians and workers in the farm.
        </p>
        <p> In the spring of 1971, the Hunan Academy of Agricultural Sciences established the Hybrid Rice Research Collaboration Group, which worked in the Hybrid Rice Research Collaboration Group of the Yuan Longping Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences.
        </p>
        <p> in 1973, the cooperation team found the recovery department through cross-examination and overcame the difficulties of the "three departments". In October, Yuan Longping published a paper entitled "Progress in Breeding Three Lines by Using" Wild Abortion "at the Rice Research Conference held in Suzhou, officially announcing that the" Three Lines "of Chinese Indica Hybrid Rice have been matched.
        </p>
        <p> In 1975, Yuan Longping conquered the "Seed Production Pass" and tried to sum up the success of seed production techniques.
        </p>
        <p> In 1977, Yuan Longping published two important papers: Practice and Theory of Hybrid Rice Cultivation and Key Techniques for Hybrid Rice Seed Production and High Yield.
        </p>
        <p> In September 2017, Yuan Longping announced a new achievement in removing heavy metal cadmium from rice at the 2017 National Exhibition of New Rice Varieties and Technologies on-site observation meeting: "Recently, we have a breakthrough technology in rice breeding, which can' knock out' genes containing cadmium or absorbing cadmium from parents. When parents are clean, seeds will naturally be clean."
        </p>
        <p> The super hybrid rice variety "Xiangliangyou 900 (Chaoyou Qianhao)" bred by "Father of Hybrid Rice" Yuan Longping and his team has set another record per mu yield. According to the third-party experts, the per mu yield of this variety of rice is 1149.02kg in the experimental field.
