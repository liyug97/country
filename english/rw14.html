          <p>Chao ji ji suan ji: a computer that can perform large amounts of data and high-speed operations that ordinary personal computers cannot handle. Its basic components are not very different from the concept of personal computer, but its specifications and performance are much stronger. It is a super-large electronic computer. It has a strong ability to calculate and process data, and is mainly characterized by high speed and large capacity, equipped with a variety of external and peripheral equipment and rich, high-function software systems. Most of the existing supercomputers can run faster than Trillion per second. </p>
          <p> supercomputer is a kind of computer with the strongest function, the fastest computing speed and the largest storage capacity. it is mostly used in the national high-tech field and cutting-edge technology research. it is the embodiment of a country's scientific research strength. it is of great significance to national security, economic and social development. It is an important symbol of the country's scientific and technological development level and comprehensive national strength.

        <p>Supercomputer refers to computers with information processing capacity one to two orders of magnitude faster than personal computers. It plays an important role in intensive computing, mass data processing and other fields. Supercomputers, also known as supercomputers, are concepts corresponding to high-performance computers or high-end computers.
          Supercomputer has a strong ability to calculate and process data. Its main characteristics are high speed and large capacity, equipped with a variety of external and peripheral equipment and rich, high-function software systems. Supercomputer adopts turbine design, each blade is a server, which can realize cooperative work and can be increased or decreased at any time according to application needs. Take China's first "Shenwei Taihu Light" built entirely with domestic processors as an example, its sustained performance is 930 million times per second and its peak performance can reach 1.25 billion times per second. Through advanced architecture and design, the separation of storage and operation is realized, which ensures that user data and data are not affected during software system update or CPU upgrade, ensures the safety of stored information, and truly realizes the advantages of long-term, efficient and reliable operation and easy upgrade and maintenance. </p>
        <p> according to different processors, supercomputers can be divided into two types, using dedicated processors or using standard compatible processors. The former can effectively deal with the same type of problems, while the latter can use one machine for many purposes, with flexible and wide application range. Specific purpose computers are commonly found in astrophysics, code breaking and other fields. International "chess masters", "deep blue" and Japan's "earth simulator" all belong to such supercomputers. many supercomputers are non-specialized systems and serve many fields such as military, medicine, meteorology, finance, energy, environment and manufacturing.
