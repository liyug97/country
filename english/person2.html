          <p>Lin Zexu (August 30, 1785-November 22, 1850) was a character fondle, and also had the characters Shaomu and Shilin. He was an old man from the village of Qicun, a resident of Bottle Spring, etc. He was an official of Fujian Province (now downtown Fuzhou) and a politician, thinker and poet of Qing Dynasty.  He was once governor of Huguang, governor of Shaanxi and Gansu, and governor of Yunnan and Guizhou. he was appointed as an imperial minister twice. he was praised as a "national hero" for advocating the prohibition of opium and resisting the invasion of western powers. </p>
          
          <p>Lin zexu fought against western invasion all his life, but he was open to western culture, science and technology and trade and advocated learning from them and using them. according to literature, he knew at least a little English and Portuguese.</p>

      <h2>Life of a character</h2>
      <div class="jiange"></div>
      <div class="renwu-main"> <span>Poor childhood</span> <p> Lin zexu's father, Lin binri, whose original name was Lin tianhan, was Meng yang, whose name was yang gu, and Jia Qing Hou Guan sui gong sheng, was a local teacher who opened a book school in the neighborhood of roche. Lin Zexu's mother, Chen Xun, is the fifth daughter of Chen Shengli, a year-old tribute student in Fujian County. Lin binri and Chen Xun had a total of 11 children: the eldest son Lin minghe (died early), the second son Lin zexu, the third son Lin peilin and eight daughters.
        </p>
        <p> Lin zexu was born in 1785 in Hou Guan county of Fujian province in the middle of the Qing dynasty. he had the character fu and the characters Shao mu and Shi Lin. he came from Jiumu forest in Putian. He wrote for his father Lin Bin-ri "Gao Feng Tong Feng Dafu Jiangning Bu Zheng Shi Xian Kao Zan Gu Fu Jun Xing Zhi" which reads: "Fu Jun taboo guest day, the word Meng Yang, the number Zan Gu, is from the Jiumu Lin family, modern national hero Lin Zexu, ancestors from Putian Jiumu Lin.
        </p>
        <p> although Lin binri is a private school teacher, he can receive public food after winning the rank of scholar. However, the family has a large population, a large number of monks and a small number of porridge, and even three meals. Lin's mother, Chen Xun, concealed her husband and secretly helped the family with the craft of needlework. She also passed on the craft of paper-cutting to her daughter to maintain family life. Although there is no need to do household chores, Lin Zexu always takes her mother's sister's handicrafts to the shop for consignment before going to the Shuxue every day. After school, Lin Zexu will collect money from the shop and return it to her mother. His poor childhood made him keep the habit of frugality when he rose to high office.
        </p>
        <p> Lin zexu had a poor childhood, but he was taught by an enlightened father and had a warm family. his childhood was very happy. Neighbors often hear the Lins' laughter when they eat, but only a dozen people are eating tofu with relish. Later, the Lins taught their children the principle of contentment.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="qingnian"> <span>Youth period</span> <p> Lin zexu was born on July 26 (August 30, 1785) in the fiftieth year of gan long in the family of a lower-class feudal intellectual in the east street of Hou Guan gu (now Gulou district, Fuzhou city). My father, Lin Bin Day, made a living by teaching, reading and lecturing. The poor income of his father's private school alone could not support his life, so his mother used manual labor to share the hardship of the family.
        </p>
        <p> in the imperial examination era, Lin zexu's parents expected their son to develop and rise in the official career. Lin Zexu was intelligent by nature. When he was 4 years old, his father "brought him into the private school with his arms on his knees" and dictated four books and five classics. Under his father's careful cultivation, he read Confucian classics earlier. In 1798, Jiaqing went to the famous Aofeng Academy in Fujian after he was a 14-year-old scholar. He was educated by Zheng Guangce and Chen Shouqi who had practical knowledge. Under the influence of his father and relatives, he began to pay attention to practical learning.
        </p>
        <p> jiaqing nine years (1804), 20 years old juren. His father's earnest and earnest teaching made Lin Zexu's academic achievements amazing. But since then, due to family difficulties, he went out to be a private tutor. In the autumn of the 11th year (1806), Fang Yongqing was appointed to Xiamen as the secretary of Haiphong Tongzhi. The opium smoke here caught his attention. In the same year, Zhang Shicheng, the new governor of Fujian, was highly appreciated and recruited into the shogunate. He learned a lot about the story of Qing Dynasty and the knowledge of soldiers, punishments, rites, music and officialdom experience in Zhang Mu, which prepared some necessary conditions for him to "enter the official career" in the future.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="zhongju"> <span>To be successful and start a family</span> <p> in the ninth year of jiaqing (1804), Lin zexu took part in the provincial examination and was the 29th juren in the examination. On the day when the ranking was announced, he formally married Zheng Shuqing. Since then, Lin Zexu has never taken a concubine in Zheng Shuqing's life and has remained deeply attached throughout his life (but according to Lin Honghan, a descendant of Lin Zexu's eldest son, Lin Zexu remarried after Zheng Shuqing's death). After Lin Zexu's death, from Tongzhi to Guangxu, Madame Tussauds in England specially made wax figures for Lin Zexu and Zheng Shuqing, becoming one of the few celebrity wax figures that can be exhibited for a long time to show their respect.
        </p>
        <p> At the end of the year, newly-married Lin Zexu left his family and went to the capital to take part in the test, but was named Sun Shan. After returning to his hometown, he set up a "Bumei Bookstore" class in Fuzhou North Library Lane to teach students, waiting for the next test.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="shitu"> <span>First-time official career</span> <p> in the 11th year of jiaqing (1806), Lin zexu served as Xiamen coastal defense tongzhi secretary, responsible for dealing with the documents and records of traders' foreign ships and rice soldiers' salaries. At that time, the smuggling of opium in Xiamen was a serious problem. Every Xiamen coastal defense official was known as a corrupt official. Bribery by foreign businessmen was common and no one cracked down on smuggling. Lin Zexu saw the opium problem and the tactics of cigarette peddlers and broadened his vision. During his tenure, he was appreciated by Tingzhang Longdao Bailing and Fujian Governor Zhang Shicheng, who recruited him as his chief of staff.
        </p>
        <p> there are different opinions as to why Zhang shicheng chose Lin zexu as his chief of staff. according to the legend of descendants of the Lin family, Zhang shicheng looked through the he qi submitted to him from all over the world and found that Lin zexu's he qi was the best. At that time, it was New Year's Eve and it was customary for officials from all over the country to pay homage to the emperor. So Lin Zexu was called in to replace the grass and worship the fold. On the way, he made things difficult. He even set off firecrackers outside his residence all night and changed the worship fold to ask Lin Zexu to copy it again. Zhang Shicheng observed Lin Zexu's accomplishment and attitude, only to see him carefully transcribe it, deeply appreciating his personality and talent, and invited him to join his staff.
        </p>
        <p> Zhang shicheng was a very personal minister, and he knew all about laws, policies, and other political knowledge. he taught Lin zexu his knowledge and political skills. even in August of the 14th year of Jiaqing (September 1809), he went with Cai Qian when suppressing pirates, making Lin zexu indirectly participate in the suppression. Zhang Shicheng praised Lin Zexu afterwards: </p>
        <p> "it's a battle, and your aides have seen the work of Yu du, who said that if I hadn't got the thief first, I wouldn't have been as quick as this."
        </p>
        <p> at the end of the same year, Zhang shicheng recommended Lin zexu's father, Lin binri, to preside over le Zheng college, which improved the Lins' economy. Later Lin zexu took part in the imperial examination again this year. unfortunately, he was still in the first place. he still stayed in Zhang shicheng as his chief of staff. It was not until the 16th year of Jiaqing (1811) that Lin Zexu finally passed the highest imperial examination, and palace examination ranked second and fourth. From then on, he set foot on the road of becoming an official.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="guanhuan"> <span>The Road of Official</span> <p> In the 16th year of Jiaqing (1811), Lin Zexu was elected in the test, awarded a Jinshi, and elected Jishi Shu from the Imperial Academy. He began to enter the official circle, realizing his parents' expectation of becoming an official. In nineteen (1814), he was appointed editor. Since then, he has successively served as the assistant examiner of the national history museum, the author officer, the tour of the study, the office of the secret hall of Qing dynasty, the deputy examiner of Jiangxi provincial examination, the examiner of Yunnan provincial examination, and the censor of Jiangnan road.
        </p>
        <p> during the kyou-kan period, he was determined to be an honest official who saved the world and helped the times. As a result, he "literature and latent repair". In order to be able to understand political affairs, "it is beneficial to study the mind and learn from the world. Although it is in the secret of Qing Dynasty, it was changed in the case of Liu Cao. The advantages and disadvantages of employing administrative personnel shall be fully verified. " During his seven years as an official in the capital, he extensively collected the memorials and writings of dozens of experts since Yuan and Ming Dynasties on the construction of Jifu Water Conservancy, and wrote "Beizhi Water Conservancy Book". In the book, it is clearly pointed out that "Zhili River is suitable for rice, and water can be used as farmland", "agriculture is the basic service of the world, and rice is also the basic service of farmers". It is believed that only by developing water resources in North China, advocating rice planting and solving the problem of grain transportation in situ can the problem of grain transportation from South to North and the resulting problems of grain transportation problems be reasonably solved.
        </p>
        <img src="../images/雕像.jpg" width="150px"> <p> in July of the 25th year of jiaqing (1820), Lin zexu was appointed as Zhejiang hangjiahu road. He actively recruited talents and suggested to build seawall water conservancy, which has done quite well. However, he felt it difficult to cope with all kinds of resistance in his official career, and he once expressed his anguish of "supporting the left but not the right" and "making it difficult for officials with three sighs". Finally, in July of the following year, he resigned under the pretext of his father's illness. Lin Zexu has done many good things for the people. Because of his impatience, he asked people to write a large character "anger control" to hang in the hall to warn himself.
        </p>
        <p> daoguang came back in April of the second year of Daoguang reign (1822) and took up the post of Jiangnan huaihai road in Zhejiang province. before he took up his post, he was in charge of the Zhejiang salt transportation administration, which has made great achievements. Lin Zexu was favored by the Daoguang Emperor and soon entered the period of rising in official circles. In the first month of the 3rd year of Daoguang (1823), he was appointed as Jiangsu provincial judge. During his term of office, he cleaned up the bureaucracy, cleared up the backlog of cases, rehabilitated unjust imprisonment, and banned opium poisoning as a social malpractice.
        </p>
        <p> in June of the 7th year of Daoguang reign (1827), he was appointed Shaanxi provincial judge and deputy governor, and was transferred to Jiangning governor in January. While waiting for the handover, there was a flood in the area of Lueyang in southern Shaanxi, so he stayed in his original post temporarily, went to Lueyang to inspect the disaster situation, resettled the affected people, and also took part in the relocation of the county seat.
        </p>
        <p> in the tenth year of Daoguang (1830), he was appointed governor of Hubei province in the autumn. in the spring of the following year, he was transferred to Henan province as governor of the east river. From June to July of the following year, Lin Zexu served as a political envoy in Hubei, Henan and Jiangning. In the face of major issues related to the people's livelihood in the riverway, the government is determined to "break with the people's feelings" and "strengthen the cause of compliance" in order to "eliminate the harmful effects of public funds and ensure the safety of workers." In order to control the Yellow River, I personally walked hundreds of miles against the cold wind to inspect the thousands of water control commercial straw. I also checked the topography and water flow along the river. Painting hanging, easy to understand and control.
        </p>
        <p> in February of the 12th year of Daoguang (1832), he was transferred to Jiangsu governor. From this year to 16 years, he has made achievements in agriculture, grain transportation, water conservancy, disaster relief and official management, especially advocating new farming techniques and promoting new farm tools. In his practical activities, he realized: "soil fertility requires human resources, and soil work belongs to agricultural work. One more dredging of the waterways means one more profit for the fields. " Lin Zexu's farming thought was experienced in the actual investigation.
        </p>
        <p> in the first month of the 17th year of Daoguang (1837), he became governor of Huguang. Faced with the frequent flooding of major rivers in Hubei every summer, Lin Zexu took effective measures and put forward the idea of "repairing and preventing the flood". As a result, "thousands of miles of long dikes in Jianghan, Puqing in An Lan, and branches of river dikes have no openings," which has made an indelible contribution to the protection of life and property in Jianghan coastal states and counties.
        </p>
        <p> In the 18th year of Daoguang (1838), Huang Juezi Shangshu, secretary of the Honglu Temple, advocated to severely punish smokers with capital punishment, and Daoguang Emperor ordered local governors to express their opinions. Lin Zexu strongly supported Huang Juezi's proposal of banning smoking, put forward six specific anti-smoking plans, and took the lead in Huguang with outstanding achievements. In August, he pointed out in a previous report that the failure to ban smoking over the years was that it could not be forbidden. Warning: "If you let it go, there will be few soldiers in the Central Plains who can defend the enemy and no money that can be charged." He was called to Beijing in September, and in eight consecutive meetings, he urged the importance of banning smoking and the strategy of banning smoking. In November, he was appointed an imperial envoy and went to Guangdong to ban smoking, control the Guangdong navy and investigate Haikou.
        </p>
        <img src="../images/图片.jpg" width="150px"> <p> Daoguang arrived in Guangzhou in the first month (March) of the 19th year (1839). He, together with Governor Deng Tingzhen of Guangdong and Guangxi, summoned foreign businessmen and ordered foreign cigarette dealers to hand over opium within a time limit. Take justice measures such as withdrawing the comprador labor service and closing down the business premises to defeat the British business supervision law in China and the guile of cigarette dealers and seize all opium from the British barges. Starting from April 22 (June 3), cigarettes were sold at Humen Beach. In 20 days, 19,179 boxes and 2,119 bags of opium were destroyed, totaling 2,376,254 kg. During this period, Lin Zexu paid attention to understanding foreign situations and organized the translation of western language books and newspapers for reference in formulating countermeasures and handling negotiations. The translated materials include "Records of Four Continents", "Chinese Affairs and Foreign Languages" and "Laws of Sliding Darfur Countries", etc., which have become the earliest documents to introduce foreign countries in modern China. In order to prevent foreign invasion, Lin Zexu made great efforts to rectify the coastal defense, actively prepared for war, purchased foreign cannons to strengthen forts, and collected patterns of foreign ships' cannons to prepare for imitation. He firmly believed in the popularity of the people, organized local regiments, recruited water courage from coastal fishermen and village households, and practiced teaching. In July, he refused to hand over the British sailors who killed Chinese villagers because of the law of righteousness, and refused to make a pledge not to carry opium with him. He ordered that British businessmen in Macao be cut off from giving aid. Righteousness resorted to force to provoke the kowloon artillery war and the naval battle across the Pacific. Lin Zexu went to Humen to protect himself. The number of inspectors defeated the British. According to the decree, Sino-British trade will be stopped in November. In December of nineteen, the Governor of Guangdong and Guangxi was actually granted. At this time, he was aware that Britain was deliberately launching a war of aggression against China, and he had received western news and played five times to ask the coastal provinces to prepare for war.
        </p>
        <p> in June of the 20th year of Daoguang (1840), after the opium war began, the British army did not attack Guangdong and Fujian, but attacked Zhejiang, sank into dinghai, and invaded dagu in the north. Daoguang Emperor was frightened and asked for peace. Lin Zexu was blamed for "poor management" in Guangdong and repeatedly issued orders to rebuke him. Lin Zexu was dismissed in September and left for Guangdong for future reference. However, they still ran to inspect the strategic passes, raised strong and brave soldiers to guard Guangzhou, and opposed the imperial minister Qi Shan's fear of the enemy and his desire for peace. Then to host the Guangdong war Yishan defense proposal, was not adopted.
        </p>
        <p> in March of the 21st year of Daoguang (1841), he was ordered to assist Zhejiang in coastal defense. In Zhejiang, we are actively planning and discussing war defense, providing artillery books, and helping to develop new types of artillery vehicles and wheel warships. In May, Emperor Daoguang defeated Guangdong and blamed his predecessor, Lin Zexu, who was stripped of the rank of Sipin Qing, severely punished and exiled to Yili. Through Zhenjiang, I gave my old friend Wei Yuan the "Records of the Four Continents" and related foreign materials to write the "Records of the Sea Countries". Because the Yellow River burst its auspicious sign in Kaifeng, Henan, causing floods, it was ordered to control the river at the Yellow River construction site in Henan, and the project was completed in Yili.
        </p>
        <p> Daoguang arrived in Yili in 1842. He assisted in the reclamation work, experienced the investigation in Kuqa, Aksu, Yerqiang and other places in southern Xinjiang, traveled 30,000 miles, advocated water conservancy and opened up wasteland. He also drew a map of the frontier and suggested that soldiers and farmers should unite to guard against the Russian threat.
        </p>
        <p> in the 25th year of Daoguang, he was re-used as governor of Shaanxi and Gansu, and was transferred to Shaanxi governor the following year. In September of the 25th, Daoguang was called back to Beijing as an alternate. In November, he acted as Governor of Shaanxi and Gansu with top hat of three products. In April of the 26th year (1846), he was appointed governor of Shaanxi and arrived in Shaanxi on the 9th of July (30th of August). At this time of Shaanxi, various social contradictions were very acute: during the opium war, the Qing government, in order to solve the military expenditure difficulty, in addition to allocating the salt tax collected by Shaanxi, forced Shaanxi to donate more than 1 million taels of silver. After the Opium War, reparations to foreign invaders were also apportioned to Shaanxi Province. The annual levy for the reparations in Xianning and Chang 'an counties in Xi 'an Prefecture alone was over 22,000, equivalent to one third of the total amount paid. In addition, there have been successive disasters in various places, making life extremely difficult for the toiling masses. "Swordsmen" from Weinan, Fuping, Sanyuan, Dali and Pucheng joined forces with the local Hui people to fight against the government one after another.

        </p>
        <p> in September of the 30th year (October 1850), he was appointed imperial secretary and went to Guangxi to suppress the peasant uprising. He started his illness in October and died on November 22, 1850 in the travel hall of Puning County, Chaozhou (now Puning North, Guangdong). Wei Yuan, a famous thinker and historian in the Qing Dynasty, heard that the elegiac couplet made a comprehensive and noble evaluation of his life's character and achievements: "Looking back on the current dynasty, I still remember chasing after Zhan Yafan; He praised the glory and honored the history, but Yin admired the hanging of the emblem. "
        </p>
        <p> In the first year of Xianfeng (1851), Xianfeng emperor gave sacrifices and burials, posthumous title "Wen Zhong" and Jin gave the prince a teacher. After Lin Zexu's death, the whole country mourned and Fuzhou built a shrine to honor him.
        </p>
        <p> At the same time, Lin Zexu and put in order managed the officials and severely punished graft and perverted the law. "To be honest, be honest first". "Teaching by example is more important than teaching by words." Lin Zexu paid great attention to strict demands on himself, setting an example in everything and setting an example everywhere. When he took up the post of Hubei governor, he issued a "pass card" in Hubei, forbidding flattery and blackmail along the way. During his term as governor, he still maintained the style of "handling everything impartially." Lin Zexu worked conscientiously and was the most honest, capable, honest and selfless official in the officialdom at that time who was loved by the masses.
