        <h3>general comment</h3>
        <p> although the Qin dynasty lasted only 15 years, the rule pattern established by Qin Shi Huang continued. Qin Shihuang was the main designer of China's centralized feudal monarchy for more than 2,000 years. His influence was deep and wide, and could not be compared with that of any other emperor. In world history, there are still many emperors who created a huge empire, but their actual influence cannot be compared with Qin Shihuang.
        </p>
        <p> China's population has always accounted for more than 20% of the world's population in history. if it has an important influence on China, it can be regarded as having an important influence on the world. moreover, due to centralization of power and loyalty to the monarch, emperors have far greater influence on China's history than on many other countries. From this, we can see Qin Shihuang's vital role to China and even the world.

        <h3>Historical evaluation</h3>
        <p> Wei Xuan: "The king of Qin is a human being, a bee is accurate, his eyes are long, his birds are sincere, the sound of jackals is loud, his kindness is less than the heart of tigers and wolves. Guyot is easy to get rid of, and his success is also easy to eat. When I was dressed in cloth, I often saw myself falling down. If the king of Qin is successful in the world, the world will become a prisoner. You can't travel with me for a long time. "
        </p>
        <p> Jia yi: "Qin Wang is greedy and despicable. he acts with self-determination. he does not believe in meritorious service, does not respect the people, abandons the king and establishes personal love. he burns documents and tortures the law. he cheats first, then acts in righteousness. tyranny is the beginning of the world."
        </p>
        <p> Lu Sheng: "Since the beginning, the emperor has been a human being. His nature has just been violent and self-employed. He has become a vassal and has ruled the world. He wants to obey and thinks that he has never been able to pass himself."
        </p>
        <p> zhufuyan: "the Qin emperor was the conqueror, encroaching on the world and annexing the warring States period. he was one in the sea and achieved three generations."
        </p>
        <p> Sima Qian: "since mui gong, he has slightly encroached on the vassals and became the first emperor. The first emperor thought that he had won and lost the five emperors and the three kings of the earth, but he was ashamed to deal with them. What a good thing Jia Sheng said! "
        </p>
        <p>《The preface of Taishi Gong》："The first emperor was established, and he was also a member of the six countries. He sold the front and cast the iron, while Wei Yan and Gan Ge proclaimed himself emperor and boasted of military strength."</p>
        <p> sang hong yang affirmed in his works that Qin Shi Huang's achievement in unifying China was "as good as qiushan's achievement, and his fame was passed on to later generations".
        </p>
        <p> Li Shimin: "In modern times, when the world was even and sides were fixed, only Qin Huang and Han Wu were involved. The emperor was tyrannical until his son died. Hanwu is arrogant and extravagant, and his country is extremely prosperous. "
        </p>
        <p> Sima Zhen: "the six countries were overthrown in two weeks. And one day, the number is the beginning of the emperor. A room cloud structure, Jin Di line. South tour le Shi, east overlooking a floating beam. The sand dunes were reported to be lost after seeing the relics in the pond. The second correction system, Zhao Gao is with. Fraud refers to deer, disaster begets tiger. When Zi Ying saw the news, he thanked your father. The lower part of the country lacks the support of the middle, while the upper part is the main part of the country. If you want to shake up the outline, who can make up for it? "
        </p>
        <p>Liu Zongyuan pointed out in his famous book "Feudalism" that Qin Shihuang abolished the enfeoffment system and established the system of prefectures and counties, which is in line with the objective and inevitable trend of historical development. The so-called "the reason why Qin was reformed is that it was a system and the public was the greatest".  The end of the public sphere began with the Qin Dynasty.  If you are not a saint, you have the potential. "</p>
        <p> Qin Zheng Ji written by Zhang Taiyan in 1913 also praised Qin Shihuang, saying: "Although there were four san huang and six or five emperors, they were not as good as Bilong."
        </p>
        <p> Xia Cengyou: "If there is an emperor in the Han Dynasty, the high-impedance is also true; For the emperors of the 24 dynasties in China, Qin Huang and Han Wu are the same. "
        </p>
        <p> Chen dengyuan's "old news of national history": "the emperor of the beginning was resolute and resolute, and he was happy to take punishment and killing as his power. he was lucky to be a full-time prison official. he was depressed and bored in the sea" </p>
        <p> Liang Qichao's "the warring States period chronicle": "Qin Shi Huang would rather be the leader of China and beg the world. it is rare to see it. It is needless to say that his martial arts are well known to all, and his political facilities are as good as those of a hundred generations. " He also believed that Qin Shihuang was the most powerful man in martial arts and the scale of the establishment of the system, but his failure lay in extravagance, despotism and taboo. Most of the historical books written in the Han Dynasty describe Qin Shihuang's extravagance and tyranny. Historians should have a clear understanding of this and should not be swayed by the paranoid records of predecessors. They should make a fair evaluation with an objective attitude.
        </p>
        <p> Huang Renyu: "How can Qin Shihuang's cruelty and cruelty reach a strange state and not be condemned? But how can he not admire the work of unifying China with such a long-term vision and with such exquisite skills? "
        </p>
        <p> Mao Zedong: </p>
        <p>1. Qin Shihuang is an expert who is thick today and thin ancient. <br/>
        2. Speak to Zhang Shizhao: You say that the Communist Party is equal to Qin Shihuang. No, it is more than 100 times. <br/>
        3. "Marx and Qin Shihuang should be combined, democracy and centralization should be combined." <br/>
        4. "Yin Zhou Wang (commonly called tyrant) is proficient in literature and military. Qin Shihuang and Cao Cao are all regarded as bad people, which is incorrect." <br/>
        Qin Shihuang was scolded for 2000 years, but now he has regained his reputation. <br/>
        6. Confucius and Mencius are idealism, Xunzi is materialism, and he is the leftist of Confucianism. Confucius represents slave owners and nobles. Xunzi represents the landlord class. He added: In the history of China, Qin Shihuang really did something. Confucius only said empty words. For thousands of years, Confucius formally acted according to Qin Shihuang. Qin Shihuang used Li Si, who was a legalist and a student of Xunzi. <br/>
        Confucius has some advantages, but he is not very good either. We should be fair. Qin Shihuang is much greater than Confucius. Confucius is empty talk. Qin Shihuang was the first person to unify China. Not only did it unify China politically, but it also unified the Chinese language and various Chinese systems, such as weights and measures, some of which have been in use since then. China's past feudal monarchs have not surpassed him for the second time, but they have been scolded for thousands of years for two things: killing 460 intellectuals; Burn some books. <br/>
        8. Advise you to scold Qin Shihuang less and discuss the cause of burning pits. The soul of the ancestral dragon is still alive in the Qin Dynasty, and the scientific name of the hole is high and solid, and it can remove chaff. A hundred generations have followed the Qin government law, and "Ten Bates" is not a good article. Read Tang Dynasty's "Feudalism" thoroughly, and don't return to Wen Wang from Zi Hou. <br/>
        9. Qin Shihuang was the first famous emperor in China's feudal society. I was also Qin Shihuang. Lin Biao called me Qin Shihuang. China has always been divided into two groups, one of which said Qin Shihuang was good and the other said Qin Shihuang was bad. I agree with Qin Shihuang but not Confucius. Because Qin Shihuang was the first to unify China, unify the written language, build a broad road, do not engage in a state within a state, and use a centralized system, with the central government sending people to various places, changing every few years without a hereditary system. <br/>
        10. Emperor Hanwu of many Qin Dynasty lost a bit of literary grace.

      <div class="west"> <h3> western evaluation </h3>
        <p> westerners have always feared China's vast territory. the difference is that Europe is always full of small countries while China is a unified country. This is mainly due to political and social factors, rather than geographical factors such as mountain barriers. Of course, Qin Shihuang played an important role in the unification of China.
        </p>
        <p> in the west, people often compare Qin Shi Huang with Caesar, the Roman emperor. Generally speaking, the population and area difference between the Roman Empire and the Qin Dynasty was not too great. But it was shorter than the Roman empire. After Caesar's death, the empire fell apart. The Qin Dynasty did not. This is the reason why Qin Shihuang had a unique influence. Therefore, Qin Shihuang is almost always ranked the highest or near the highest in any world ranking list of outstanding emperors.
