        <p>On June 21, 1965, Yang Liwei was born in Suizhong Town, Suizhong County, Liaoning Province. Since he was a child, he lived in the seaside. When he was a child, he had a dream that one day he could fly towards the blue sky like seagulls. </p>
        <p> yang liwei loved reading very much when he was a child. he wrote a composition "I met premier Zhou" and was included in the composition collection. My father Yang Deyuan and my mother Wei Guilan worked as teachers in a middle school in the town (my father later transferred to the County Native Produce Company). Xiao Liwei was relatively weak, introverted and lacking in courage from an early age. In order to change Xiao Liwei's character, every winter and summer vacation, my father takes him to climb mountains and swim in the Liugu River in the east of the county. In autumn, take him to climb trees and pick fruits in the mountains. Since then, Xiao Liwei has become interested in exploration and sports. He often travels with his partners, climbing the Huxian Cave Mountain to visit the Fox Cave, searching for the ruins of the ancient temple, and searching for the legendary "chained well". After watching war stories films such as "Sparkling Red Star", "Batman Zhang Ga" and "Chicken Hair Letter", he begged his father to help his classmates make the red tasselled spear and volunteered to be the children's colonel. After watching "flying tigers", he has always dreamed of being a train driver, but he did not expect to become the first person in China's space.
        </p>
        <p> in June 1983, when he was in the third grade of high school, the air force recruitment personnel had to select pilots from the local fresh graduates. yang Liwei, who had dreamed of joining the army since childhood, was the first to report his name to the registration office. after strict selection, investigation, physical examination and face-to-face tests, yang Liwei, 18, became a student of the air force flight academy of the Chinese people's liberation army.
        </p>
        <p> June 21, 2016 is the 51st birthday of yang Liwei, China's first astronaut. The NASA History Program Office tweeted on the morning of the 21st, US time, wishing Yang Liwei a happy birthday.
