          <p>Manned space flight is a round-trip flight activity in which human beings drive and ride manned spacecraft to engage in various kinds of exploration, research, test, production and military applications in space. Its purpose is to break through the earth's atmosphere barrier and overcome the earth's gravity, to expand the range of human activities from land, sea and atmosphere to space, to have a wider and deeper understanding of the entire universe, and to make full use of the special environment of space and manned spacecraft to carry out various research and test activities, and to develop the extremely rich resources of space. At present, only the United States, China and Russia have independent manned space capabilities. </p>
          <p> Ivan Moiseev, head of scientific research at Moscow Space Club, believes that the United States is still in the lead in the space field, and China, Europe and Russia are basically at the same level after that. Moiseev believes that China is overtaking Russia in applied space fields such as earth remote sensing, communications and navigation, but lags behind Russia in manned space and Europe in basic space research.
          </p>
          <p> it should be pointed out that the EU, India and Japan can be listed as "quasi-manned spaceflight capability countries".

        <p>Manned space flight refers to the round-trip flight activities of human driving and taking manned spacecraft in space for various exploration, test, research, military and production. The purpose of manned space flight is to break through the barrier of the earth's atmosphere and overcome the earth's gravity, to expand the range of human activities from land, sea and atmosphere to space, to have a wider and deeper understanding of the earth and its surrounding environment, and to better understand the whole universe. Make full use of the special environment of space and manned spacecraft to engage in various experiments and research activities to develop space and its rich resources. Manned spacecraft is implemented by manned space system. Manned space system consists of manned spacecraft, carrier, spacecraft launch site and return facilities, space measurement and control network, etc. Sometimes it also includes other ground support systems, such as ground simulation equipment and astronaut training facilities. </p>
        <p> manned spacecraft can be divided into manned spacecraft, manned space station and space shuttle according to flight and working methods: ① manned spacecraft can be divided into single-person spacecraft and multi-person spacecraft according to the number of passengers, and into satellite manned spacecraft and lunar manned spacecraft according to the operating range. (2) Manned space station is also called orbit station or space station, which can be used by many astronauts to live and work. (3) The space shuttle can be used as both a manned spacecraft and a space station for manned space activities and a reusable carrier.
        </p>
        <p> manned space technology is a major breakthrough in human space history.
        </p>
        <p> manned space flight began on April 12, 1961 when Gagarin entered earth orbit on board the eastern spacecraft. Today, many countries have their own astronauts. Russian, American and Chinese manned spacecraft carry astronauts from many countries to soar in space. Manned spacecraft have developed from a single spacecraft to a huge space station.
        </p>
        <p> the manned space programs that have been implemented and are being implemented include: the former Soviet union's east, rise, alliance, salute and peace; Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, Skylab and Space Shuttle in the United States; US-Europe Joint Space Shuttle-Aerospace Laboratory; An international space station with the cooperation of the United States, Russia, Europe, Japan and Canada; Shenzhou and Tiangong in China.
