      <h2>Memorial building</h2>
      <div class="jiange"></div>
      <div class="jinian-main"> <p> In 1953, Qiu Shaoyun Martyrs Memorial Hall was set up in Tongliang County, Sichuan Province, and Qiu Shaoyun Martyrs Memorial Hall was set up at the top of Fenghuang Mountain. Zhu De wrote the inscription.
        </p>
        <p> in the museum, the pagoda tree is graceful, the camphor tree is fragrant, and the ancient banyan tree spreads its huge canopy between the green grass and the red flowers. The exhibition hall and the monument are separated by a natural pool, standing in the shade, looking solemn and imposing. On the wall of the main entrance of the memorial hall is engraved the name of the museum inscribed by former President Yang Shangkun. On both sides of the main entrance are fire-shaped buildings, which embody the symbolic significance of the Fire King.
        </p>
        <img src="../images/纪念碑1.jpg" width="150px"> <p> Qiu Shaoyun Martyrs Memorial Hall, a memorial hall for Chinese revolutionary figures, is located at 64 Democracy Road, Chengbachuan Town, Tongliang County, Chongqing. The museum was built in October 1962 to commemorate Qiu Shaoyun, a "first-class hero" and a "special hero" of the Chinese People's Volunteers, who bravely devoted themselves to the war to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, on the 391 high-altitude battlefield, to take care of the entire war situation and regard discipline as more important than life. The museum consists of a monument and a hall for displaying heroic deeds.
        </p>
        <p> Qiu Shaoyun Martyrs Monument, located in front of the exhibition hall, is 15 meters high and its name is inscribed by Zhu De. The front of the monument bears the inscription "Monument to the Martyrs of Qiu Shaoyun". The back bears the biographies of the martyrs. The top of the monument is a 5-meter-high statue of the martyrs. The front of the monument seat is embossed with a gold star medal, olive leaves and submachine guns, followed by a Class I national flag medal. The heroic deeds exhibition hall displayed more than 250 pieces of clothing, pictures and auxiliary displays of martyrs, showing and praising the life of martyrs in Qiu Shaoyun.
        </p>
        <p> The Qiu Shaoyun Deeds Exhibition Hall covers an area of over 1700 square meters. There are an orderly hall, a painting and calligraphy exhibition hall and four heroic deeds exhibition halls. A total of more than 190 cultural relics, including relics of martyrs, pictures, inscriptions of central leaders, certificates of recognition of martyrs by President Kim Il Sung of the North Korean government, medals and gifts to families of martyrs, were displayed to show the glorious life of Qiu Shaoyun martyrs.
        </p>
        <p> In 1992, General Secretary Jiang Zemin wrote an inscription: "Carry forward the spirit of Qiu Shaoyun and build a strong army". Yang Shangkun inscribed the name of Qiu Shaoyun Martyrs Memorial Hall. Martyrs Memorial Hall has been successively named by the State Council, the Ministry of Civil Affairs and the Central Propaganda Department as "National Key Martyrs Memorial Building Protection Unit", "National Patriotism Education Base", "National Martyrs Memorial Hall Building Management Advanced Unit", "National 100 Patriotism Education Demonstration Bases" and other national honors.
        </p>
        <p> In order to commemorate the heroes and learn from Qiu Shaoyun's communist spirit, a line of bright red lacquer characters was engraved on the cliff of 391 highland's magnificent mountain: "Comrade Qiu Shaoyun, a great soldier who sacrificed himself for the whole and victory, will never die!" The majestic mountain peaks, rock walls and bright red paint characters are historical monuments of the unity and fighting between the Chinese and Korean peoples.
        </p>
        <p> Since the opening of Qiu Shaoyun Martyrs Memorial Hall on October 12, 1962, it has received more than 2 million people from North Korea, Hong Kong and Macao compatriots, overseas Chinese and people from all walks of life.
