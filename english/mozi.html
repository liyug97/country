<h1>Mozi number</h1>
<div class="box_details">
  <p> <img src="images/87.jpg" alt="" title="" class="right" width="250" height="200"/>Mozi quantum science experimental satellite (referred to as Mozi No.), at 1:40 on August 16, 2016, the launch of the Long March II carrier rocket in Jiuquan was successfully launched. The successful completion of this launch mission marks another important step in China's space science research. </p>
  <p>Fang Jianwei, the chief scientist of China Quantum Satellite, said that if the ground quantum communication constructs a "net" connecting each city and each information transmission point, then the quantum science experimental satellite is like a shot. "Javelin" to space. When this quantum communication "World of Heaven and Earth" is woven, massive information will come and go in it, and "unconditional" security. On January 18, 2017, the world's first quantum science experimental satellite "Mozi" launched by China successfully completed the four-month on-orbit test mission and was officially delivered to the user unit. Relevant leaders of the University of Science and Technology of China, Chinese Academy of Sciences and other units signed the certificate of delivery.</p>
  <p>January 31, 2019, was awarded the 2018 Cleveland Award. Chinese researchers said in Washington, DC, on February 14, 2019 that the "Mozi" quantum science experimental satellite is expected to exceed life expectancy, continue to work for at least two years, and launch more international cooperation. </p>

<h2 class="h2"><span>1</span>R&D Background</h2>
<div class="content">
  <p>Quantum-based secure communication technology has moved from laboratory demonstrations to industrialization. In the city, the metro quantum network communication constructed by optical fiber has begun to try practical applications. China has achieved international leading position in metro optical fiber quantum communication. </p>
  <p>In the international race of quantum communication, China is a latecomer. After years of hard work, China has become one of the world's leading experts in quantum information research, and is also in the forefront of the world's quantum communication technology. It has completed the construction of large-scale quantum communication metropolitan area networks such as Hefei and Jinan, and the “Beijing-Shanghai trunk line”. The large-scale fiber-optic quantum communication backbone network is also about to be completed. </p>
  <p>However, this is just the beginning. "In the city, building a metropolitan quantum communication network through fiber optics is the best solution. But to achieve long-distance and even global quantum communication, relying solely on fiber-optic quantum communication technology is not enough." Pan Jianwei said. </p>
  <p>Quantum secure communication can guarantee information security in three aspects. First, the information interaction between the sender and the recipient is secure and will not be eavesdropped or stolen. Second, the identity of the "master servant" can be automatically confirmed. Only the main talent can call the "servant", while others cannot command the "servant." Third, once the passphrase between the sender and the recipient is maliciously tampered with, the user knows immediately and resends and receives the command. </p>
  <p> Originally, information was transmitted by quantum communication, and the smallest energy unit of light was transmitted. But this smallest particle can no longer be split and cannot be copied. Even with the most advanced ideal single photon detectors available today, point-to-point quantum communication in 1000 km of fiber can only transmit one bit per 300 years. “It’s like a team with 1 million people. In the end, there may be only a few people left, it takes a long time to reach the destination.” This problem is limited by the fiber, can not amplify the quantum communication signal, resulting in far away The efficiency of information transfer on the distance is very low, making scientists unable to do anything. Although the quantum relay method, that is, divided into several segments to reduce the loss of each segment, solves this problem with the "quantum relay" method, it will take time to go to practical application. </p>
  <p> Later, scientists realized that there would be no loss of light in the vacuum. To achieve global wide-area quantum secure communication, it is also necessary to use satellite transit. </p>
  <p>In 2005, Pan Jianwei team realized the quantum entanglement and key distribution experiment of 13 km free space, which proved that the photon can be effectively maintained after the photon penetrates the atmosphere, thus verifying the feasibility of the quantum communication. A series of follow-up experiments carried out in recent years have laid the technical foundation for launching quantum satellites.
</p>
  <p>"In this way, thousands of kilometers of quantum communication can be achieved by launching satellites and removing interference factors." Pan Jianwei said that with quantum satellites, it is possible to test the so-called non-localized quantum mechanics at macroscopic distances. Sex, that is, "ghostly overreaching effect." “Look at the theory that is constantly being retested in the lab and whether it can be achieved in space.”</p>
</div>
<h2 class="h2"><span>2</span>Name Reasons</h2>
<div class="content4"><br>
  <p>The first quantum communication satellite was named after the name of the ancient Chinese scientist Mozi. Mozi first proposed the idea of ​​light propagation along a straight line, and carried out a small hole imaging experiment. Named after him to commemorate his achievements in early physical optics. </p>
  <p>Mozi first discovered through the small hole imaging experiment that light is linearly propagated, and the first scientific explanation of the straight line propagation of light - this is a very important principle in optics, which has laid a foundation for the development of quantum communication. A certain foundation. Mozi also proposed particle theory in a certain sense. The optical quantum experimental satellite is named after the Chinese scientist Xianxian Mozi, which reflects China's cultural self-confidence. </p>

<div class="content5">
  <p>The Quantum Satellite Engineering is under the overall responsibility of the National Space Science Center of the Chinese Academy of Sciences; the University of Science and Technology of China is responsible for the development of scientific objectives and the development of scientific application systems; the Shanghai Institute of Microsatellite Innovation of the Chinese Academy of Sciences is the master satellite system, Shanghai Institute of Technical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences Jointly develops the payload sub-system of China University of Science and Technology; the National Space Science Center of the Chinese Academy of Sciences is responsible for the development, construction and operation of the ground support system; the Earth Observation and Digital Earth Science Center and other units participated.

<h2 class="h2"><span>4</span>target task</h2>
<div class="content11">
  <p>The quantum satellite is one of the first batch of scientific experimental satellites for the space science pilot project of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The main scientific goal is to use the satellite platform to carry out the high-speed quantum key distribution experiment of the satellite, and on this basis, the wide-area quantum density Key network experiments, in order to achieve a major breakthrough in the practical application of space quantum communication; second, quantum entanglement distribution and quantum teleportation experiments on the spatial scale, the experimental study of spatial scale quantum mechanics completeness test. </p>
  <p>The Mozi number will launch four experimental missions in the world for the first time in the next two years to achieve two scientific goals: conducting a satellite relay high-speed quantum key distribution experiment via satellite relay, and based on this "A wide-area quantum communication network experiment", in order to make a major breakthrough in the practical application of space quantum communication; (the third goal) and "the two-way entanglement distribution experiment" and "spatial scale quantum teleportation experiment", the development of spatial scale quantum Experimental study of the completeness test of mechanics. In addition to satellites, four quantum communication ground stations (located in Xinglong, Hebei, Urumqi, Xinjiang, Delingha, Qinghai, Lijiang, Yunnan) and Quantum Teleportation Experimental Station in Ali, Tibet, were also built on the ground. In addition, scientists from the Austrian Academy of Sciences and the University of Vienna have also cooperated with the Chinese side to set up ground stations in Vienna and Graz</p>
