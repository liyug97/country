      <h3> great anger Xiang jun </h3>
      <p> once when Qin Shi Huang was on a tour, he was almost unable to cross the river due to strong winds in Xiangshan shrine. Qin Shihuang asked the doctor (a kind of official position at that time) and said, "what god is Xiang jun?" The doctor replied, "I heard Yao's daughter, shun's wife, is buried here." Qin Shihuang was very angry with this Xiangjun, believing that he was deliberately against him, and sent someone to cut down all the trees on Xiangshan. Because the place is red clay, Xiang mountain has also become a red bald mountain.

      <h3> mars staying at antares </h3>
      <p> mars staying at antares refers to an astronomical phenomenon, "Mars" refers to Mars. Because Mars is twinkling like fire and its whereabouts are uncertain, it was called "Mars" in ancient times. But Mars is considered to be the representative of war and death. During the thirty-six years (the first 211 years) of Qin Shihuang, it appeared. According to historical records, a meteorite fell in Dongjun and turned into a stone when it landed. Some people carved on the stone "The first emperor died and the land was divided." When the Emperor heard this, he sent a censor to go to the house to inquire. No one pleaded guilty, so he captured and killed all the people living around the stone and burned the meteorite.

      <h3> zulong died this year </h3>
      <p> one day in late autumn in the thirty-sixth year (211 years ago) of Qin Shi Huang, Qin Shi Huang was still traveling quickly when a stranger suddenly appeared in front of him and stopped the carriage. The man took a piece of jade in his hand and quietly gave it to the messenger. The emissary took over suspiciously, but before he could speak, the other side said a word: "Zulong died this year"! Hit the floor. The messenger was scared to death. "Zulong died this year." Ancestor, is the ancestor, the first person; Dragon, the image of monarch. It means Qin Shihuang will die this year. The stranger dropped the stone-like cold words, dropped his face and walked away quickly. The messenger returned to his mind and tried to find it again. People had already disappeared.

      <h3> a room, a room, the emperor died </h3>
      <p> "a room, a room, the emperor begins to die." This rhyming popular minor was handed down in Qin Shihuang's 26th year (221 years ago). At that time, the common people and civilian workers were burdened with the construction of Epang Palace. This slogan is undoubtedly the voice of the people.
      </p>
      <h3> the deceased Qin zhehu also </h3>
      <p> Qin Shihuang asked Lu Sheng to visit immortals everywhere. He brought back books from overseas and said, "Even those who died of Qin Hu also died." Qin Shihuang thought Hu was a Hu and sent 300,000 people to attack the Huns in the north. But what I didn't expect was that the Qin Dynasty perished at the hands of his son Hu Hai.
