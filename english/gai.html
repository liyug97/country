        <p>The 500-meter spherical radio telescope uses the potholes in Guizhou karst area as the telescope site to build the world's largest single-caliber radio telescope with a receiving area of 30 standard football fields.  As the world's largest single-aperture telescope, FAST will maintain a world-class position in the next 20 to 30 years.  The brand-new design idea, combined with the unique location advantage, has broken through the 100-meter engineering limit of the telescope and created a new mode of building a giant radio telescope. </p>

        <h3> address </h3>
        <p> the FAST site is selected at dawudang depression in jinke village, kedu town, pingtang county, Qiannan buyi and Miao autonomous prefecture, Guizhou province. the depression is located at 25.647222 north latitude, 106.85583 east longitude, with a diameter of about 800 meters, 85km from pingtang county town in the northeast and 45km from Luodian county town in the southwest. It is generally located in the slope zone where Guizhou Plateau transits to Guangxi hills. The terrain is generally high in the north and low in the south. Carbonate rocks are widely distributed in the region. Karst peaks, depressions and sinkholes are extremely developed. The terrain is rugged and low mountain. The highest mountain ridge in Dawudang depression is the southeast mountain top with elevation 1201m, the lowest elevation 841m, and the maximum relative elevation difference is 360m m. Karst depressions on the surface of depressions are developed, with large topographic relief, steep slope, simple landform type, and steep local mountains, forming steep cliffs and overhanging walls. The Chinese Academy of Sciences has registered the Guizhou Radio Observatory in Guiyang City, Guizhou Province to manage the project.
        </p>
        <p> there are three reasons for the site selection of "dawodang". first, the landform is closest to the FAST shape and the amount of excavation is the smallest. Second, the karst geology here can ensure that rainwater permeates into the ground without damaging and corroding the telescope due to deposition on the surface. Third, the radio telescope needs a "quiet soil" and there is not a township within a radius of 5 kilometers near Dawudang. The radio environment is ideal.
