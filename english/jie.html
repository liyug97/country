      <h2>Cable net structure</h2>
      <div class="jiange"></div>
      <div class="jianjie-main">
        <p>Cable net structure is the main supporting structure of FAST active reflecting surface and is the key point of active displacement of reflecting surface. The cable net manufacturing and installation project is also one of the main technical difficulties in the 500-meter-diameter spherical radio telescope project. Its key technical problems mainly include the design of the installation scheme of the ultra-long span cable net, the development of the ultra-high fatigue performance cable structure, and the manufacturing process of the ultra-high precision cable structure. The successful completion of the cable-net project means that the FAST project has achieved substantial breakthroughs in the above-mentioned key technical difficulties.</p>
        <img src="../images/索网.jpg" width="200px">
        <p>The 1FAST cable net structure is 500 meters in diameter, divided by geodesic grids, and designed discontinuously, i.e. the main cables are disconnected by nodes. Some key indexes of the cable net structure are far higher than the specifications in relevant fields at home and abroad: for example, the control precision of the main cable section must be within 1 mm, the position precision of the main cable node must be up to 5 mm, and the fatigue strength of cable members must not be lower than 500MPa. The whole cable network consists of 6,670 main cables, 2,225 main cable nodes and the same number of lower cables. The total weight of the cable net is about 1300 tons, and the cross section of the main cable has a total of 16 specifications with a cross-sectional area of 280-1319 square millimeters. Due to site conditions, all cable structures must be assembled at high altitude. </p>
        <p> the cable net adopts a unique working mode of active displacement, that is, according to the orientation of the observed celestial body, the cable is controlled by an actuator to form paraboloids with a diameter of 300 meters in different areas of a 500-meter-diameter reflecting surface, so as to realize celestial body observation.
        </p>
        <p>FAST cable net is the cable net structure with the largest span and the highest precision in the world, and it is also the first cable net system in the world to adopt displacement working mode. The technical difficulty is self-evident, and the technical difficulty to be overcome runs through the whole process of designing, manufacturing and installing the cable net. Taking the development of high stress amplitude steel cables as an example, the requirements of FAST engineering on fatigue performance of cables are equivalent to twice the specified value in the specification, and there is no experience or data available for reference at home and abroad. The research and development work has gone through repeated "failure-recognition-modification-perfection" process, and finally it took one and a half years to complete the technical research. The results obtained have been recognized by foreign expert groups at international expert review meetings and have been successfully applied to FAST projects. With the continuous overcoming of many technical problems of cable net, 12 independent and innovative patent achievements have been formed, including 7 invention patents. These achievements have greatly promoted the level of cable structure engineering in China.
