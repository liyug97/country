        <p>With the development of science and technology, computers have become more closely connected with us. In the context of big data, supercomputers have also invested a lot in the application of big data. However, due to the influence of virtualization characteristics, supercomputer systems are prone to failure problems, which bring inconvenience to units and users. In order to reduce the occurrence of this kind of situation and prolong the service life of the supercomputer, it is necessary to carry out regular maintenance on the supercomputer. </p>
        <p> scientific and reasonable methods should be adopted in the maintenance of supercomputers in order to improve the performance and working efficiency of supercomputers and further prolong the service life of supercomputers. The maintenance of supercomputers is divided into hardware maintenance and software maintenance. Hardware maintenance refers to the regular inspection and proper cleaning of supercomputer hardware equipment. Attention should be paid to avoid moving equipment as much as possible to avoid damage to equipment. Software maintenance refers to the backup of supercomputer software, regular cleaning of useless files, and attention to prevent viruses from infecting supercomputers as much as possible, so as to avoid damaging supercomputer systems and threatening the information security of companies, research institutions and individuals.
        </p>
        <p> supercomputers are prone to the following failures during maintenance: startup problems, hardware problems and software problems. To solve the problem of supercomputer failure, relevant personnel should take timely maintenance measures to maintain the supercomputer. First of all, when the supercomputer fails, it should be judged reasonably to determine what causes the supercomputer to fail to work normally and not repair the supercomputer blindly, so as to strengthen the inspection of the machine itself and the surrounding environment. Secondly, after determining the failure of the supercomputer, the author conceives the possible causes of the failure and how to deal with the failure, so as to clarify the overall thinking of the failure maintenance, so that the subsequent maintenance work can be carried out smoothly and the efficiency of the maintenance work can be improved.
        </p>
        <p> in addition, the network security of supercomputers needs to be well protected. In the process of protecting the supercomputer network, hackers and Trojan viruses should be avoided. The database needs to be backed up and restored, and the more important data should be backed up and updated, so that even if there is an accident, the data can be restored through backup to avoid unnecessary losses. The more important point is to prevent viruses. By installing a virus firewall, the system can be scanned and monitored, and viruses can be found and removed in time. Since supercomputers are mostly used in scientific research institutions, it is necessary to install offensive software to improve the contextual function of supercomputer systems. Once external intrusion occurs, the system can timely warn and effectively intercept it.
