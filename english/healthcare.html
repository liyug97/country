<h2 class="h2"><span>2</span> Purpose</h2>
<div class="content4"><br>
  <p>Health has five main purposes: openness to all, quality, effectiveness, economics, patient and staff satisfaction. </p>
</div>
<h2 class="h2"><span>3</span>Country comparison</h2>
<div class="content6"><br>
  <h2>Type</h2>
  <p>The biggest influence of national politics on a country's health care is to define its financial system. The financial system of the health care organization of the OECD countries can be divided into three categories:</p>
  <p>National economy: health care established through taxation (eg UK, Italy)</p>
  <p>Social insurance: established through statutory health insurance (eg Germany, France)</p>
  <p>Private insurance: personal or corporate insurance (eg US)</p>
  <p>Generally there are multiple economic ways to mix in a country. The ratio of public spending on health care in many countries has increased in recent years. </p>
  <h2>Quality comparison</h2>
  <p>The rising price of health care has become an economic priority in all parts of the world, and the quality of health care is difficult to compare, so it is rarely noticed. For example, the high proportion of patients in the population does not necessarily mean that the local medical care quality is poor. Conversely, a diabetic patient will die in a poorly-healthy area, and Yule disappears from the patient's statistics. In a country with good health care, he can live a long time, but in this way he has become a member of the country's patient statistics for a long time. </p>
  <p>The World Health Organization listed a table for the health of its 191 member states in the 2000 World Health Report. The method of this list is academically controversial. The distribution of residents' health status, responses to residents and patient requirements, patient rights and satisfaction, the likelihood of residents accessing health care services, and the fairness of prices are indicators of evaluation. </p>
  <p>The following are the top ten of this list:</p>
    <p>France</p>
<p>Italy</p>
<p>San Marino</p>
<p>Andorra</p>
<p>New Zealand</p>
<p>Singapore</p>
<p>Spain</p>
<p>Oman</p>
<p>Austria</p>
<p>Japan</p>
