Guo Moruo regarded Wang Guowei's "the history of song and yuan operas" and Guo Guo Guowei's "the history of song and yuan operas" as a double wall in modern Chinese academic history. On the other hand, he collated, proofread and collated dozens of ancient books, such as "Ancient Novels Hook and Sink", "Ji Kangji", "Han Portrait Collection" and "Miscellaneous Collection of Historical Books in Huiji County", which left a huge fortune for later classical literature research.

        <p> Lu Xun can be called the national soul of modern China. his spirit has deeply influenced his readers, researchers, and even generations of modern Chinese writers and intellectuals. Lu Xun is also one of the world cultural giants in the 20th century. He created the literature of "both inside and outside, merging with the world's trend of thought of the times, but not undermining China's national character" and having a unique personal style of "Chinese people who want to participate in the world's undertakings today".

        <span> political influence </span>
        <p> Lu Xun pursued democracy all his life. as early as the beginning of the new literature movement, Lu Xun declared war on the old feudal culture and constantly fought against the old ideology and culture that oppressed the people. After the "Female Normal University Student Movement" took place, Lu Xun argued with the warlords persecuting the students. Lu Xun defying violence and writing a war showed the spirit of an upright scholar. Then the Kuomintang boldly disclosed its dark rule under its rule. In the thirties, Lu Xun fought against the wrong left-leaning line of literature and art in the Communist Party. Later, he established a left-wing writers' alliance led by proletarian literature and art ideas in cooperation with literary and art workers under the leadership of the Party. Lu Xun, as the leader of the left-wing alliance, led the left-wing alliance to smash the Kuomintang reactionary literature and art's plot to strangle proletarian literature and art.
