    <h1>Wanli Great Wall</h1>
    <div class="box_details">   
      <p> <img src="images/61.jpg" alt="" title="" class="right" width="250" height="200"/>The Great Wall, also known as the Great Wall It is a military defense project in ancient China. It is a tall, sturdy and continuous long raft that is used to limit enemy riding. The Great Wall is not a purely isolated city wall, but a defense system that combines a city wall as the main body and a large number of cities, barriers, pavilions, and standards. </p>
      <p>The history of the construction of the Great Wall can be traced back to the Western Zhou Dynasty. The famous allusion of the martyrdom of the capital, Xi'an (now Xi'an, Shaanxi Province) originated here. During the Spring and Autumn Period and the Warring States Period, the countries competed for hegemony and defended each other. The Great Wall built the first climax, but the length of construction was relatively short. After the Qin and the Six Kingdoms unified the world, Qin Shihuang connected and repaired the Great Wall of the Warring States, and was known as the Great Wall. The Ming Dynasty was the last dynasty to overhaul the Great Wall. Today, many of the Great Walls that people saw were built at this time. </p>
      <p>The Great Wall resources are mainly distributed in 15 provinces, autonomous regions, such as Hebei, Beijing, Tianjin, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, Inner Mongolia, Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning, Shandong, Henan, Qinghai, Ningxia and Xinjiang. Among them, Shaanxi Province is the province with the richest resources in China's Great Wall. The length of the Great Wall in China is 1,838 kilometers. According to the results of the National Great Wall Resources Survey of the Cultural Relics and Surveying and Mapping Department, the total length of the Ming Great Wall is 8851.8 kilometers, and the Qin and Han Great Walls exceed 10,000 kilometers, with a total length of more than 21,000 kilometers. </p>

    <h2 class="h2"><span>1</span>History</h2>
    <div class="content">   
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>The Great Wall is an ancient defense project with the longest construction time and the largest amount of engineering in China. Since the Western Zhou Dynasty, it has been continuously built for more than 2,000 years and distributed on vast land in northern and central China. More than 50,000 kilometers. </p>
      <p>Since Qin Shihuang, all the dynasties that ruled the Central Plains region had to build the Great Wall. More than ten dynasties, including Han, Jin, Northern Wei, Eastern Wei, Western Wei, Northern Qi, Northern Zhou, Sui, Tang, Song, Liao, Jin, Yuan, Ming and Qing, have built the Great Wall on different scales. From the perspective of the ruling nation building the Great Wall, in addition to the Han nationality, many dynasties that ruled China by the minority also repaired the Great Wall, and there were more dynasties than the Han dynasty. During the Kangxi period of the Qing Dynasty, although the construction of the Great Wall was stopped, the Great Wall was built in some places. It can be said that since the Spring and Autumn Period and the Warring States Period, it has not stopped building for more than 2,000 years in the Qing Dynasty. </p>
      <p>According to historical documents, more than 20 vassal states and feudal dynasties built the Great Wall. If the Great Wall built in each era is added up, there are more than 100,000 miles, including the length of the Great Wall of the Qin, Han and Ming dynasties. More than 10,000 miles.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="content1">
      <h2>Pre-Qin</h2>
      <p>The history of the Great Wall construction can be traced back to the Western Zhou Dynasty. In order to defend against the attacks of the northern nomadic people, the Zhou Dynasty built a series of castles "Liecheng" for defense. In the Spring and Autumn Period and the Warring States Period, the countries in order to fight for hegemony and defend each other, built the Great Wall on the border according to their respective defensive needs. The earliest building was the "Chu Fang City" in the 7th century BC, followed by Qi, Han, Wei, Zhao and Yan. The vassal states of the Qin and Qin dynasties have successively built the "Great Walls of the Privileges and Defences" for self-defense. Among them, the Qin, Zhao, and Yan countries and the powerful nomadic Xiongnu in the north are adjacent to each other. At the same time, they built the "Great Wall of the Rejection of the Hu" in the north, and the monarchs of the past dynasties almost all strengthened and improved. At this time, the Great Wall is characterized by different directions in the east, south, west and north, and the length is short, ranging from several hundred kilometers to 1000-2000 kilometers. In order to distinguish it from the Great Wall of the Great Emperor of Qin Shihuang, the historian called it the "pre-Qin Great Wall." </p>
    </div>
    <div class="content2">   
      <h2>Qin Dynasty</h2>
      <p>Twenty-six years of Qin Shihuang (221 BC), Qin annexed the six countries and unified the world, establishing the first unified multi-ethnic and centralized state in Chinese history. In order to maintain and consolidate the security of the unprecedented unified empire, Qin Shihuang successively adopted a series of major strategic measures for national defense construction and defensive preparation. One of them was the large-scale construction of the Great Wall. In the 32nd year of Emperor Qin Shihuang (the first 215 years), the generals rate 300,000 troops to attack the Xiongnu, take the Henan area, and then build up "Linqi in the west (now Shanni County, Gansu), east to Liaodong (now Liaoning Province), The Great Wall of more than 10,000 miles. Since Qin Shihuang built the Great Wall, it has been known as the Great Wall. </p>
      <p>The Great Wall of Qin Shihuang is roughly: West from Ganyu County, Gansu Province, north of the Luan River to Linyi County, from Linyi County to the northeast of Dingxi County to the northeast to Guyuan County of Ningxia. From Guyuan to the northeast through the ring county of Gansu Province, Shaanxi Province, Jingbian, Hengshan, Yulin, Shenmu, and then north to the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in Tokto South, to the south bank of the Yellow River. The Great Wall to the north of the Yellow River is from the Langshan Mountain in the western part of the Yinshan Mountain Range. It is inserted into the north of the Daqing Mountain in the east and continues to the east through the Inner Mongolia Jining and Xinghe to the Shangyi County in Hebei. From Shangyi to the northeast through Zhangbei and Weichang counties in Hebei Province, and then eastward through Fushun and Benxi to the southeast, ending at the Qingchuan River in the northwest of Pyongyang, North Korea. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="content3">   
      <h2>Han Dynasty</h2>
      <p>In the early Han Dynasty, the Xiongnu took the Huaxia War and crossed the Qin Dynasty to build the Great Wall, and the Han Empire confronted the Qin, Zhao and Yan Great Walls of the Warring States. Because the Great Wall was in disrepair for a long time, the northern defenders were scarce, so the powerful Huns continued to plunder within the Great Wall. However, such a ruined Great Wall has also played a military defense role to a certain extent. Cheng did not know that he was a famous general who was stationed in the Great Wall. He ruled the army harshly, and he did not dare to commit crimes as long as he took the Huns. The defenders Qing, Huo went to the disease, Gongsunhe, Gongsun, and other attacking the Huns, all of them took the Qin and Zhao Great Wall as the main base for the attack. </p>
      <p>After the emperor of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty, he successively launched several wars against the Xiongnu, expelled him to Mobei, repaired the Qin Great Wall built by Mengzi, and built the Great Wall, and built a Dawanyu Town in the west. The Great Wall, which is nearly 10,000 kilometers long on the north bank of the Yalu River. At this time, the Qin, Zhao, and Yan Great Walls of the Warring States Period were abandoned and their military defenses ended. </p>
      <p>The Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty built the Great Wall to expel the Huns. It played a great role in maintaining the security of the Western Han Empire. It also safeguarded the smooth and safe Silk Road and had extraordinary historical significance. </p>
    </div>
    <h2 class="h2"><span>2</span>Architectural Method</h2>
    <div class="content4"><br>
      <p>The defensive engineering building of the Great Wall's defensive engineering building has accumulated rich experience in the construction process of more than two thousand years. </p>
      <p>First of all, in the layout, when Emperor Qin Shihuang built the Great Wall, he summed up the important experience of "causing the terrain and using the danger to make the plug", and then Sima Qian wrote it into the "Historical Records". After that, every dynasty built the Great Wall. It is carried out in accordance with this principle and has become an important basis for military deployment. Anyone who builds a Guancheng Pass is chosen between the two mountain valleys, or where the river turns, or where the Pingchuan must pass, so that it can control the risks and save manpower and materials. , Wanfu Mokai" effect. Building a castle or a beacon is also a matter of choice. As for the construction of the city walls, the terrain is fully utilized. For example, the Great Walls like Juyongguan and Badaling are built along the back of the mountain. Some areas are very dangerous from the outside of the city wall, and the inner side is very gentle. "Effect. In Liaoning, the Great Wall of Liaodong Town in the Ming Dynasty had a mountain wall and a gabled wall. It was the steep wall of the cliff and the cliff was slightly cut to become the Great Wall. In other places, cliffs and rivers and lakes are used as natural barriers. </p>
      <p>Many structural methods have been created on the construction materials and building structures with the principle of “local materials, application of materials”. There are structures such as bauxite, stone and stone, and masonry; in the desert, the structure of red willow branches, reeds and sand layers is also used. It has been preserved for more than 2,000 years in Yumenguan, Yangguan and Xinjiang. The remains of this great wall in the pre-Western Han Dynasty. </p>
      <p>With the progress of social productivity, the continuous development of brick making technology, the output of brick products in the Ming Dynasty has been greatly increased, and it is no longer a precious building material. Therefore, the walls inside and outside the walls of many places in Ming Great Wall are built with giant bricks. At that time, all the manual construction, by manual handling of building materials, the use of small weight, the same size of brick masonry walls, not only convenient construction, but also increased the construction rate and improved the level of construction. Secondly, many gates have been built with large bricks and large-arched arches. Although some of these bricks have been severely weathered, the entire city gate is still majestic, showing the superb skills of arching at that time. Judging from the architectural decoration on Guanyin's tower, many stone carving techniques are extremely complicated and elaborate, reflecting the artistic talents of craftsmen at that time. </p>
    </div>
    <h2 class="h2"><span>3</span>Building Structure</h2>
    <div class="content5">   
      <h2>Wall body</h2>
      <p>The wall is the main part of the city wall, with an average height of 7.8 meters and some sections up to 14 meters. Where the hills are steep, the construction is relatively low, and the flat places are relatively high; the critical places are relatively high, and the general places are relatively low. The wall is the main part of defending the enemy. Its total thickness is wide, the base width is 6.5 meters, and the width of the wall is 5.8 meters on average, ensuring that two heavy horse-drawn carriages are in parallel. The wall consists of an outer wall and an inner wall, filled with earth and gravel. </p>
      <p>The outer wall refers to the side of the outer wall to the outside of the city. When constructing, there is obvious income, and the score is generally 125% of the wall height. The collection of the wall can increase the width of the lower part of the wall, enhance the stability of the wall, enhance its defensive performance, and make the outer wall majestic. The inner wall refers to the side of the outer wall. When constructing, there is usually no obvious collection, and the vertical wall is built. The thickness of the outer wall is generally determined by the thickness of the wall at the mouth. The thickness is generally one brick and a half width, and the thicker the lower the ratio according to the proportion of the collection. The brick masonry method is mainly flat. </p>
      <p>The wall of the Great Wall is the main part of this defense project. It is built in the mountains or plains, and is built according to the needs of terrain and defensive functions. It is built to be very tall and strong in the plains or in the main places, and low and narrow in the dangerous places in the mountains to save manpower and Costs, and even some of the most steep places that can't be built, are convenient to adopt the “mountain wall” and methods. The walls of the Great Wall in Juyongguan, Badaling and Hebei, Shanxi, Gansu, etc., generally average about 7 or 8 The bottom of the meter is about 6 or 7 meters thick, and the top of the wall is about 4 or 5 meters wide. On the top of the city wall, there is a wall inside, which is 1 meter high, in order to prevent the patrol soldiers from falling. The outer side is set with a wall of squatting, about 2 meters high. The upper part of the wall is provided with a cornice and the lower part has a hole and a meteorite hole. Watch the enemy and shoot, roll the rock. On the top of some important walls, there are also layers of barriers to resist the enemies who climbed the wall. In the middle of the Ming Dynasty, when the anti-animated general Yu Jiguang was transferred to the general army of the town, he made a major improvement to the fortifications of the Great Wall. On the top of the city wall, an enemy building or enemy station was set up to accommodate patrol soldiers and store weapons and food socks to make the Great Wall The defense function is greatly enhanced. </p>
      <p>The wall is built by brick, stone and masonry. When the slope is small, the bricks or stones are parallel to the terrain, and when the slope is large, the horizontal drop is used. The way to build.

    <div class="content6">   
      <h2>beacon fire</h2>
      <p>The Great Wall system has a large number of beacon fire (Beacon) as the information delivery system, which is the oldest but effective way of messaging. </p>
      <p>The ancient border defense alarm has two kinds of signals. In case of enemy situation, the smoke during the day is called “beacon”, and the fire at night is called “燧”, the platform is connected, and the message is transmitted. Smoke is burned during the day and fire is raised at night because the sun is strong during the day, the fire is hard to see, the smoke is relatively eye-catching, and the smoke at night is not obvious, and the fire can be seen from a long distance. This is a very scientific method. In order to report how many enemy soldiers committed, it is also distinguished by the number of smokers and fires. By the time the Ming Dynasty was still burning cigarettes and raising the number of fires, the sound of guns was added to enhance the effect of the alarm, so that the military situation could be quickly transmitted thousands of miles away. According to the Ming Dynasty system, a smoke and a gun show that the enemy is about 100 people; two smokers and two guns, about 500 enemy troops; more than 1,000 people to raise three smoke and three guns. According to the location and function of the configuration, the beacon fire can be divided into four groups: the beacon tower located in the depths of the desert is the front line for issuing warnings. The beacons set along the two sides of the Great Wall transmit information along the line, and the series from the Great Wall to the Jingshi The beacon tower is in contact with the dynasty's central government, and a group of beacon towers are in contact with local governments and garrisons near the Great Wall. </p>
      <p>The building of the plaque was earlier than the Great Wall, but since the Great Wall appeared, the beacon tower along the Great Wall was closely integrated with the Great Wall and became an important part of the Great Wall defense system, and some were built on the Great Wall. In the Han Dynasty, it was called Tingsui, Tang and Song dynasties was called tower, and the word “beacon fire” was also extended to Beacon Tower. In the Ming Dynasty, it was generally called the smoke pier or pier (the northwest Ming Dynasty pier The big ones have the function of defending the enemy, while the small ones only have the function of igniting the fire. The beacons are generally about 10 miles apart, and the Ming Dynasty also has a distance of about 5 miles. </p>
      <p>The layout of beacon fire is also very important. The key is to place it in the place where the mountain is dangerous or the peak and the turn, and the three cockroaches that must be adjacent are in the field of view of each other, so that the message can be viewed and transmitted at any time. In addition to transmitting military conditions, it also provides services such as accommodation and food supply for the protection of the envoys. In some sections of the Great Wall, only the platform, the pavilion, and the wall are not built. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="content8">   
      <h2>Castle</h2>
      <p>The castle is divided into acropolis, guardian or dry house city and fort city according to the grade. It is arranged on the inner side of the Great Wall according to the defense system and military requirements, and there are those outside the wall. </p>
      <p>The distance between the city and the city is about a hundred miles away. The perimeter of the Acropolis is 6-9 miles. The perimeter of the city is 4-5 miles. The brick wall, the peripheral horse face, the turret, the city gate Jianyecheng Some of the city gates are also built outside the city or the wing city facing the gate of the city to strengthen the gates of the city. There are government offices, barracks, houses and temples in the city. The distance between Wei, the city and the Great Wall is either near or far, depending on where the location of the Great Wall is moderate, the terrain is gentle, and it is convenient for you to build. </p>
      <p>Baocheng or the border town, the distance is about 10 miles, the city week is 1-3 miles, the brick city is smashed, the 1-2 door is opened, and the city gate is built. There are garrison camps, school yards and temples in the city. The distance between the side walls and the Great Wall is generally no more than 10 miles. When you are in police, you can quickly go to the city. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="content9">   
      <h2>Guancheng</h2>
      <p>Guancheng is the most concentrated defense base on the Great Wall. The location of Guancheng is crucial. It is chosen to be in the favorable defensive terrain, in order to receive the effect of resisting powerful intruders with very little force. The ancient name is “One husband is off, Wanfu is open”, vividly Explain the importance of Guancheng. </p>
      <p>The city of Guancheng along the Great Wall is large and small, with a large number. As far as the Guancheng of the Ming Great Wall is concerned, there are nearly a thousand large and small. There are many small customs in the vicinity of some big Guancheng. For example, there are more than ten small customs cities near Shanhaiguan, which together form the defense engineering building system of the Great Wall. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="content10">   
      <h2>length</h2>
      <p>Because of the age, most of the Great Walls of the early dynasties were incomplete, and the relatively intact ones were the Great Wall built in the Ming Dynasty. Therefore, the Great Wall refers to the Great Wall, which is called the length of the Great Wall. The length of the Great Wall. </p>
      <p>The State Administration of Cultural Heritage and the State Bureau of Surveying and Mapping jointly announced on April 18, 2009 that the Ming Great Wall starts from Hushan, Liaoning, west to Jiayuguan, Gansu, and travels from east to west through Liaoning, Hebei, Tianjin, Beijing, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, and Shaanxi. 156 counties in 10 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities) of Ningxia, Gansu and Qinghai, with a total length of 8851.8 kilometers. After 359.7 kilometers, the natural natural danger is 2232.5 kilometers. </p>
      <p>On June 5, 2012, the State Administration of Cultural Heritage announced in the Juyongguan Great Wall in Beijing that after nearly five years of investigation, the total length of the Great Wall in China was 21,196.18 kilometers, including the wall of the Great Wall, the hustle and bustle, the single building, and the Guanbao. And the related facilities such as the Great Wall Heritage 43721. This is the first time that China has scientifically and systematically measured the total length of the Great Wall. The investigation and identification of the Great Wall not only confirmed the length of the Ming Great Wall measured in 2009, but also carried out resource surveys of the Great Wall in Qin and Han and other times. </p>

      <h2> Sideband development</h2>
      <p>From the Qin and Han Dynasties to the Ming and Qing Dynasties, many gates along the Great Wall have become the places or centers of the two major economic and cultural systems of agriculture and animal husbandry, and some have gradually developed into important towns along the Great Wall.
